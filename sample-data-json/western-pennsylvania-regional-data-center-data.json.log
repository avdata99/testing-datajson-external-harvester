Validate FAILED. 316 datasets

 - Dataset: 311 Data: This data set shows 311 service requests in the City of Pittsburgh. This data is collected from the request intake software used by the 311 Response Center in the Department of Innovation & Performance. Requests are collected from phone calls, tweets, emails, a form on the City website, and through the 311 mobile application. 

For more information, see the 311 Data User Guide.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Air Quality: Air quality data from Allegheny County Health Department monitors throughout the county. 

Air quality monitored data must be verified by qualified individuals before it can be considered official. The following data is unverified. This means that any electrical disruption or equipment malfunction can report erroneous monitored data.
 - Dataset: Right of Way Permits: Submitted permits which affect the public right of way, including; road openings, machinery, valet parking, traffic obstructions and more.
 - Dataset: Pittsburgh PLI Violations Report: Dataset containing Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI) violation notices that have been issued by the City of Pittsburgh after October 15, 2015
 - Dataset: Police Incident Blotter (30 Day): The 30 Day Police Blotter contains the most recent initial crime incident data, updated on a nightly basis. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. The information is "semi-refined" meaning a police report was taken, but it has not made its way through the court system. This data is subject to change once it is processed and republished using Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards. The UCR coding process creates a necessary delay before processed data is available for publication. Therefore, the 30 Day blotter will provide information for users seeking the most current information available.   

This dataset will be continually overwritten and any records older than thirty days will be removed. Validated incidents will be moved to the Police Blotter Archive Dataset. Data in the archived file is of a higher quality and is the file most appropriate for reporting crime statistics. 

This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)

[Crime Data Guide](http://www.wprdc.org/crime/)
 - Dataset: Daily Community Center Attendance: Daily count of individuals who have visited City Community Centers since March 2011.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Weights and Measures Inspections: Inspections conducted by the Allegheny County Bureau of Weights and Measures. The Bureau inspects weighing and timing devices such as gas pumps, laundromat timers, parking meters, and produce scales. The Bureau also conducts price scan verifications on a regular basis to ensure consumers are being charged fairly.
 - Dataset: Police Incident Blotter (Archive): The Police Blotter Archive contains crime incident data after it has been validated and processed to meet Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards, published on a nightly basis. This data validation process creates a data publishing delay of approximately thirty days. Users who require the most recent incident data should use the 30 Day Police Blotter. The 30 Day Police Blotter dataset contains more recent data, but has not yet been run through quality control and standardization procedures by the Police Bureau. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. 

This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)

[Crime Data Guide](http://www.wprdc.org/crime/)
 - Dataset: Non-Traffic Citations: Non-traffic citations (NTCs, also known as "summary offenses") document low-level criminal offenses where a law enforcement officer or other authorized official issued a citation in lieu of arrest. These citations normally include a fine. In Pennsylvania, NTCs often include a notice to appear before a magistrate if the person does not provide a guilty plea. Offenses that normally result in a citation include disorderly conduct, loitering, harassment and retail theft.  

This dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police. It does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (for example, campus police or Port Authority police).

 - Dataset: City Revenues and Expenses: City Revenues and Expenses from the Operating Budget from 2012 to Present, updated every night from the City's JD Edwards ledger.
 - Dataset: Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data: Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. However, arrests can occur as a result of other offenses, such as parole violations or a failure to appear for trial. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level.

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Building Footprint Locations: This dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled roof outlines of
buildings.  All near orthogonal corners
are square.  Buildings that are less than
400 square feet are not captured. 
Special consideration is given to garages that are less than 400 square
feet and will be digitized when greater than 200 square feet.  Interim rooflines, such as dormers and party
walls, as well as minor structures, such as carports, decks, patios, stairs,
etc., and impermanent structures, such as sheds, are not shown. Large buildings
which appear to house activities that are commercial or industrial in nature
are shown as commercial/industrial. Structures that appear to be primarily
residential in nature, including hotels and apartment buildings are shown as
residential buildings. Structures which appear to be used or owned primarily by
governmental, nonprofit, religious, or charitable organizations, or which serve
a public function are shown as public buildings. Structures which are closely
associated with a larger building, such as a garage, are shown as an out
building. Structures which cannot be clearly defined as Industrial/Commercial;
Residential; Public; or Out Buildings are flagged as such for later
categorization. The classification of buildings is subject to the
interpretation from the aerial photography and may not reflect the building’s
actual use.  Buildings that have an area
less than the minimum required size for data capture will occasionally be
present in the Geodatabase.  Buildings
are not removed after they have been digitized and determined to be less than
the minimum required size.<br /><br />

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Land Use Areas: <p>Allegheny County land use as ascribed to areas of land. The Land Use
Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled information concerning
vegetation and limited open areas of ground. The Land Use Feature Dataset
contains Woodlands, Nurseries and Orchards, Cultivated Fields and Athletic
Fields. Woodlands are groups of trees, whether coniferous or deciduous.
Woodland areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the
aerial photography. Nurseries and Orchards are areas that indicate cultivated
trees. These areas are usually identified because the trees are found in evenly
spaced rows. Nursery and Orchard areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size
are digitized from the aerial photography. Cultivated Fields are those areas
that are used for crops. Pasture land and land that, according to the aerial
photographs and aerial interpretation, has been permitted to lie fallow for an
extended period is not considered cultivated areas. Cultivated Field areas that
are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the aerial photography.
Athletic Fields are sport fields that have a natural surface. The apparent
outline of the land area used for athletic purposes is digitized from the
aerial photography and not just the actual athletic field.</p>

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Block Areas: <p>This dataset overlays a grid on the County to assist in locating a parcel.
The grid squares are 3,500 by 4,500 square feet. The data was derived from
original MAPINDX: Map Index Sheets from Block and Lot Grid of Property
Assessment and based on aerial photography. Tiles are numbered in a clockwise
spiral fashion starting with #1 at the point in downtown Pittsburgh. Each tile
contains 16 Blocks. Each Index Sheet contains 16 lot/block sheets, labeled from
left to right, top to bottom (4 across, 4 down): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K,
L, M, N, P, R, S. The first (4) numeric characters in a parcelID indicate the
Index sheet in which the parcel can be found, the alpha character identifies
the block in which most (or all) of the property lies.</p>

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Hydrology Areas: <p>The Hydrology Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled water
drainage features and structures including rivers, streams, drainage canals,
locks, dams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and mooring cells.  Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater
than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream
edges and River Edges.  The Ohio River,
Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major River polygons.  All other River and Stream polygons are coded
as River. A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic
feature.  Drainage Canals are
differentiated from streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or
bottom stabilized to prevent erosion for the predominant length of the
feature.  Streams may have had some
stabilization done, but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large
standing bodies of water greater than five acres in size.  Ponds are large standing bodies of water
greater than one acre in size and less than five acres in size.  Reservoirs are manmade embankments of
water.  Included in this definition are
both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are greater than one
acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and Hidden Drainage
Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water flows through a
manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not being updated
but will be preserved.  If a drainage
feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the associated
drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a structure to
which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage. 
They are normally constructed of concrete and steel and are anchored to
the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling. Mooring Cells do not
currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will be added. Locks are
devices that are used to control flow or access to a hydrologic feature.  The edges of the Lock are captured.  Dams are devices that are used to hold or
delay the natural flow of water.  The
edges of the Dam are shown.</p>

<p>Development Notes:  This data set is a digital soil survey and
generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing,
or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This
data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute
data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a
detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that
normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be
cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer
(point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of
features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough
and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil
map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System
relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component
soils and their properties.  The soil map
and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of
the National Cooperative Soil Survey</p>

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Hydrology Lines: <p>The Hydrology Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled water
drainage features and structures including rivers, streams, drainage canals,
locks, dams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and mooring cells. Rivers, Lakes, Ponds,
Reservoirs, Hidden Lakes, Reservoirs or Ponds: If greater than 25 feet and less
than 30 feet wide, is captured as a double line stream. If greater than 30 feet
wide it is captured as a river. Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater
than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream
edges and River Edges.  The Ohio River,
Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major Rivers. All other
River and Stream polygons are coded as River. If a stream is less than 25 feet
wide it is placed as a single line and coded as a Stream.  Both sides of the stream are digitized and
coded as a Stream for Streams whose width is greater than 25 feet.  River edges are digitized and coded as River.
A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic feature.  Drainage Canals are differentiated from
streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or bottom stabilized to
prevent erosion for the predominant length of the feature.  Streams may have had some stabilization done,
but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than five acres in size.  Ponds are
large standing bodies of water greater than one acre in size and less than five
acres in size.  Reservoirs are manmade
embankments of water.  Included in this
definition are both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are
greater than one acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and
Hidden Drainage Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water
flows through a manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not
being updated but will be preserved.  If
a drainage feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the
associated drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a
structure to which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage.  They are normally constructed of concrete and
steel and are anchored to the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling.
Mooring Cells do not currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will
be added. Locks are devices that are used to control flow or access to a
hydrologic feature.  The edges of the
Lock are captured.  Dams are devices that
are used to hold or delay the natural flow of water.  The edges of the Dam are shown.</p>

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Mortgage Foreclosure Records: This data includes filings related to mortgage foreclosure in Allegheny County. The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.

As Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.

After a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.

The data presented here is in beta form because only the most recent filing type is included as of September 2017.  Monthly updates are forthcoming.  It is also our intent to include a record for each filing type for each docket if the data becomes available.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Restaurant/Food Facility Inspections: Facilities located within Allegheny County that produce, distribute and sell food products are subject to mandatory, routine inspection by one of the health department's staff of environmental health specialists.

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Municipal Building Energy and Water Use: This dataset contains energy and water use information from 2010 to 2014 for 144 County-operated buildings. Metrics include: kBtu (thousand British thermal units), site and source EUI (energy use intensity), annual electricity, natural gas and steam consumption and cost, and water and sewer use and cost. Weather-normalized data enable building performance comparisons over time, despite unusual weather events.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Fatal Accidental Overdoses: *** DEPRECATION WARNING: Monthly updates to accidental fatal overdose updates will be recorded in the first file `Fatal Accidental Overdoses` going forward. This file currently contains all records available to the WPRDC (from 2008 until the most recent update date).***

***The old yearly files will remain the same through March 31st 2019.  Afterwards they will be compressed and shared here as a zip file.***

Fatal accidental overdose incidents in Allegheny County, denoting age, gender, race, drugs present, zip code of incident and zip code of residence.

Zip code of incident is where the Office of the Medical Examiner received the body, not necessarily where the overdose occurred. 

Data includes closed cases only and the previous calendar year data will be updated monthly until the close of the current calendar year. For example, the 2014 resource will be updated monthly until December 2015.

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Park Rangers Outreach: Launched in June 2015, the Allegheny County Park Rangers program reached over 48,000 people in its first year. Park Rangers interact with residents of all ages and also run a successful Parks-to-Schools program.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Crash Data: Contains locations and information about every crash incident reported to the police in Allegheny County from 2004 to 2018. Fields include injury severity, fatalities, information about the vehicles involved, location information, and factors that may have contributed to the crash. Data is provided by PennDOT and is subject to PennDOT's data privacy restrictions, which are noted in the metadata information section below.

The map below shows car crashes in Allegheny County during 2016, with the color indicating whether it was a rear end collision or not.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Dog Licenses: A list of dog license dates, dog breeds, and dog name by zip code. Currently this dataset does not include City of Pittsburgh dogs.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Tax Liens (Filings, Satisfactions, and Current Status): Tax liens are a method the government uses to secure an interest in unpaid tax debt. This dataset represents information about county, municipal, school district, and water/sewer tax liens by parcel (and property identification number, where available). This dataset includes the name of the municipality, county or school district filing, the date that the lien was filed, and the tax amount at the date of filing.

This data is based on records that were filed dating back to 1995. This dataset will be updated with the previous month's filings as new data becomes available (typically, close to the beginning of the month).

Delinquent Tax Docket numbers are not unique identifiers. Instead, users need to combine the Delinquent Tax Docket number, the tax year, and the lien description.

This dataset represents our best effort to describe the state of tax liens. Users are encouraged to consult the Allegheny County Department of Court Records web site, as it is the definitive and most reliable source for this information:

https://dcr.alleghenycounty.us/

More detailed and up-to-date information on each lien can be found on that site.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions: This dataset contains data on all Real Property parcels that have sold since 2013 in Allegheny County, PA.

Before doing any market analysis on property sales, check the sales validation codes. Many property "sales" are not considered a valid representation of the true market value of the property. For example, when multiple lots are together on one deed with one price they are generally coded as invalid ("H") because the sale price for each parcel ID number indicates the total price paid for a group of parcels, not just for one parcel. See the Sales Validation Codes Dictionary for a complete explanation of valid and invalid sale codes.

Sales Transactions Disclaimer: Sales information is provided from the Allegheny County Department of Administrative Services, Real Estate Division. Content and validation codes are subject to change. Please review the Data Dictionary for details on included fields before each use. Property owners are not required by law to record a deed at the time of sale. Consequently the assessment system may not contain a complete sales history for every property and every sale. You may do a deed search at http://www.alleghenycounty.us/re/index.aspx directly for the most updated information.
Note: Ordinance 3478-07 prohibits public access to search assessment records by owner name. It was signed by the Chief Executive in 2007.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Property Assessments: Real Property parcel characteristics for Allegheny County, PA. Includes information pertaining to land, values, sales, abatements, and building characteristics (if residential) by parcel. 
Disclaimer:
Parcel information is provided from the Office of Property Assessments in Allegheny County. Content and availability are subject to change. Please review the Data Dictionary for details on included fields before each use.
Property characteristics and values change due to a variety of factors such as court rulings, municipality permit processing and subdivision plans.  Consequently the assessment system parcel data is continually changing. 
Please take the dynamic nature of this information into consideration before using it.
Excludes name and contact information for property owners,
as required by Ordinance 3478-07.

 - Dataset: Pittsburgh Police Firearm Seizures: This data includes counts of  firearms by type seized by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Each row describes a seizure incident involving one or more firearms.
 
Firearm seizures can occur for several reasons. One of the Bureau of Police justifications for seizing a firearm involves a suspicion that a firearm was used in a criminal offense. Seizures may also occur to protect officer or public safety. For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended  weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.
 
The Bureau’s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized. Where possible, the Bureau makes every effort to return firearms that have been seized to their rightful owners.
 
Firearms seized by non-City of Pittsburgh law enforcement agencies within the City of Pittsburgh may not be included in this data. Federal, State, County, and other special law enforcement agencies (e.g. campus, transit, hospital, etc.) operate within the City limits.
 
Data collected through supplemental reports filled out by Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers upon taking possession of a firearm.
 
Locations where the seizure occurred  are anonymized to the address block or nearest intersection. It's not always possible to geocode these anonymized addresses.  In cases where geocoding fails, the latitude and longitude fields are left empty.  These will display as "None" in table views on the WPRDC site.
 
Exact date and report numbers have been removed to protect the privacy of individuals and any active investigations.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County 911 Dispatches - EMS and Fire: The Allegheny County 911 center answers and dispatches 911 calls for 111 out of 130 municipalities in Allegheny County. Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.

To protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:
  
* Aggregated event location to census block groups.  
* Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year. 
* Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. 
* Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  
* Checked frequency of calls w/ sensitive health information: 
    * If the number of calls for a certain month/year and census block group was greater than 5, the call description was included.  
    * If less than 5, the call description was redacted. 

Events requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.

The call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description. 

A small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a "null" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as "Removed".

The 19 municipalities that dispatch their own EMS, Fire, and/or Police services are called "ringdown municipalities". These are subject to change. The list can be found in the Ringdown Municipalities 2019 resource.
 - Dataset: Pittsburgh Public School Locations: Pittsburgh Public School locations, including early childhood facilities
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Toxics Release Inventory: The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) data provides information about toxic substances released into the environment or managed through recycling, energy recovery, and treatment in the United States. Annual releases are compiled and reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and shared on the TRI Website. The TRI covers over 650 chemicals and chemical groupings across a broad range of industries. Chemicals covered are linked to cancer or other chronic human health effects, tied to significant adverse human health effects, or significant adverse environmental effects.
 - Dataset: 2014 Capital Project Budgets: City of Pittsburgh capital project budgets.
 - Dataset: 2011-2018 City of Pittsburgh Operating Budget: This dataset shows the 2011-YTD operating budgets for the City of Pittsburgh.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Median Age at Death: The median age at death is calculated for each municipality in Allegheny County. Data is based on the decedent's residence at the time of death, not the location where the death occurred. Median age by municipality is based on “official” death records that have been released by the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Data is broken out by race (white/black), and also includes a count of deaths for City of Pittsburgh neighborhoods and Allegheny County Municipalities.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Older Housing: Older housing can impact the quality of the occupant's health in a number of ways, including lead exposure, housing quality, and factors that may exacerbate respiratory conditions, like asthma. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau contains Census Tract estimates of housing age, and Allegheny County assessment data provides parcel-level information on the year residential properties were built.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Elevated Blood Lead Level Rates: Lead is a neurotoxin commonly found in our daily lives. While lead has been eliminated from gasoline, household paint, and solder, you can still be exposed to lead from many different sources including dust containing lead from pre-1978 lead paint, paint chips, contaminated soils, water, ceramic plates, bowls, and glasses, and imported candy, toys, cosmetics, and jewelry

Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, academic achievement, and other behavioral issues.

As of January 1, 2018, Allegheny County requires every child under age six to be tested for lead exposure. The first of two tests will be conducted when a child is approximately 9-12 months old, and the second test will take place around the child’s second birthday. According to the Allegheny County Health Department, 53% of County children born in 2016 were tested for lead between the ages of nine to 12 months. This share has risen from 30% of County children born in 2009.

Children are initially tested with a capillary, or “finger prick” blood test. If an elevated level of lead is found, a venous blood test will be administered to confirm the result. For more information on the testing methods, please see the Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure in Allegheny County report, released in September, 2018. The Allegheny County Health Department currently treats confirmed blood lead level tests with 5 µg/dL or more of lead as elevated. This measurement is based on the CDC’s reference level for public health action, established in May 2012.

If a child under age 6 tests with a confirmed blood lead level of 5 µg/dl and above, ACHD offers a free home inspection. The goal of this inspection, along with XRF readings, sampling of dust, soil, and water, is to help identify any sources of lead exposure in the home. The inspection includes identifying possible alternative sources of lead exposure from jewelry, toys, cosmetics, parent occupations and/or hobbies. Inspectors also educate the family about how good nutrition can mitigate absorption of lead and immediate steps the family can take to reduce lead exposure in the home. ACHD also offers free lead testing for the uninsured or underinsured at its Immunization clinic, and at WIC offices in McKeesport and Wilkinsburg. 

The Allegheny Lead Safe Homes Program currently provides free home repairs to keep families safe from lead paint. This program will test for lead-based paint in the home and will aid with repairs and prevention education to Allegheny County homeowners or renters who meet income requirements and whose home is built before 1978. All work is done in a lead-safe manner. Eligible residents must either have a child under 6 years or a pregnant woman in the household.

 - Dataset: Allegheny County Certified MWDBE Businesses: According to the Federal Department of Transportation, Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) are for-profit small business concerns where socially and economically disadvantaged individuals own at least a 51% interest and control management and daily business operations. To encourage participation in government contracting, these businesses can be eligible for contract set-asides and help organizations meet participation goals.To participate in these programs, a small business owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals must receive DBE certification from the relevant state– generally through the state Uniform Certification Program (UCP).The Pennsylvania Unified Certification Program (PA UCP) (dotsbe.pa.gov) is designed as "one-stop shopping" for firms seeking certification as a DBE or an Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE).  The PA UCP is established in accordance with 49 CFR Part 26 and 49 CFR Part 23 (More information can be found at www.ecfr.gov). Allegheny County is a certifying participant in the PA UCP.  Firms wishing to be certified can do so at no cost through the M/W/DBE (Minority, Women, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) Department. This dataset contains all the firms currently certified by Allegheny County M/W/DBE. It does not necessarily include all certified businesses in Allegheny County. A complete list of firms certified by the PA UCP is available at dotsbe.pa.gov.
 - Dataset: Autonomous Vehicle Survey of Bicyclists and Pedestrians in Pittsburgh: In Pittsburgh, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology.
We hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.

We conducted our 2017 survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.

Regarding the 2019 survey: In total, 795 people responded. BikePGH solicited responses from their blog, website, and email list. There were also a few local news articles about the survey. While many questions were kept similar to the 2017 survey, BikePGH wanted to dig a bit deeper into regulations as well as demographics this time around.

The 2019 follow up survey also aims to see how the landscape has changed, and how specifically, Pittsburghers on bike and on foot feel about sharing the road with AVs so that we’re all better prepared to deal with this new reality and help make sure that it is introduced as safely as humanly possible.

 - Dataset: Market Value Analysis - Allegheny County Economic Development: In early 2018, the County Department of Economic Development, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2018 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for Allegheny County.  A similar MVA was completed with the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2016. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.

The 2016 Allegheny County MVA does not include the City of Pittsburgh, which was characterized at the same time in the fourth update of the City of Pittsburgh’s MVA. All calculations herein therefore do not include the City of Pittsburgh.
While the methodology between the City and County MVA's are very similar, the classification of communities will differ, and so the data between the two should not be used interchangeably. 

Allegheny County's MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. Most data used covers the 2013-2016 period, and data used in the analysis includes:

•Residential Real Estate Sales;
• Mortgage Foreclosures;
• Residential Vacancy;
• Parcel Year Built;
• Parcel Condition;
• Owner Occupancy; and
• Subsidized Housing Units.

The MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

During the research process, staff from the County and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.

Data on school enrollment and grade or level attending were derived from answers to Question 10 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). People were classified as enrolled in school if they were attending a public or private school or college at any time during the 3 months prior to the time of interview. The question included instructions to “include only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.” Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of
a person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area.

School enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in “vocational, technical, or business school” such as post secondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and
on job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire includes instructions for how to classify home schoolers.

Enrolled in Public and Private School – Includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for “public school, public college,” or “private school, private college, home school.” The instruction guide defines a public school as “any school or college controlled and supported primarily by a local, county, state, or federal government.” Private schools are defined as schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups. Home schools are defined as “parental-guided education outside of public or private school for grades 1-12.” Respondents who marked both the “public” and “private”
boxes are edited to the first entry, “public.”

Grade in Which Enrolled – From 1999-2007, in the ACS, people reported to be enrolled in “public school, public college” or “private school, private college” were classified by grade or level according to responses to Question 10b, “What grade or level was this person attending?” Seven levels were identified: “nursery school, preschool;” “kindergarten;” elementary “grade 1 to grade 4” or “grade 5 to grade 8;” high school “grade 9 to grade 12;” “college undergraduate years (freshman to senior);” and “graduate or professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).”

In 2008, the school enrollment questions had several changes. “Home school” was explicitly included in the “private school, private college” category. For question 10b the categories changed to the following “Nursery school, preschool,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 12,” “College undergraduate years (freshman to senior),” “Graduate or professional school beyond a bachelor’s degree (for example: MA or PhD program, or medical or law school).” The survey question allowed a write-in for the grades enrolled from 1-12.

Question/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS enrollment status question (Question 10a) refers to “regular school or college,” while the 1996-1998 ACS did not restrict reporting to “regular” school, and contained an additional category for the “vocational, technical or business school.” The 1996-1998 ACS used the educational attainment question to estimate level of enrollment for those reported to be enrolled in school, and had a single year write-in for the attainment of
grades 1 through 11. Grade levels estimated using the attainment question were not consistent with other estimates, so a new question specifically asking grade or level of enrollment was added starting with the 1999 ACS questionnaire.

Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population universe in the ACS includes people living in group quarters. Data users may see slight differences in levels of school enrollment in any given geographic area due to the inclusion of this population. The extent of this difference, if any, depends on the type of group quarters present and whether the group quarters population makes up a large proportion of the total population. For example, in areas that are home to several colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18 to 24 who were enrolled in college or graduate school would increase, as people living in college dormitories are now included in the universe.

 - Dataset: Pittsburgh American Community Survey 2014 - Miscellaneous Data: Miscellaneous Reports from the 2014 American Community Survey Report
 - Dataset: Pittsburgh American Community Survey Census Data 2014 - Sex by Occupation: Occupation describes the kind of work a person does on the job. Occupation data were derived from answers to questions 45 and 46 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Question 45 asks: “What kind of work was this person doing?” Question 46 asks: “What were this person’s most important activities or duties?”

These questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. For employed people, the data refer to the person’s job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job.

These questions describe the work activity and occupational experience of the American labor force. Data are used to formulate policy and programs for employment, career development, and training; to provide information on the occupational skills of the labor force in a given area to analyze career trends; and to measure compliance with antidiscrimination policies. Companies use these data to decide where to locate new plants, stores, or offices.
 - Dataset: Pittsburgh American Community Survey Data 2015 - Household Types: The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to Question 2 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all people in housing units. The question on relationship is essential for classifying the population information on families and other groups. Information about changes in the composition of the American family, from the number of people living alone to the number of children living with only one parent, is essential for planning and carrying out a number of federal programs.

The responses to this question were used to determine the relationships of all persons to the householder, as well as household type (married couple family, nonfamily, etc.). From responses to this question, we were able to determine numbers of related children, own children, unmarried partner households, and multi-generational households. We calculated average household and family size. When relationship was not reported, it was imputed using the age difference between the householder and the person, sex, and marital status.

Household – A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements.

Average Household Size – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in
households by the number of households. In cases where people in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, people in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.

Average household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Comparability – The relationship categories for the most part can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected in the decennial census, CPS, and SIPP. With the change in 2008 from “In-law” to the two categories of “Parent-in-law” and “Son-in-law or daughter-in-law,” caution should be exercised when comparing data on in-laws from previous years. “In-law” encompassed any type of in-law such as sister-in-law. Combining “Parent-in-law” and “son-in-law or daughter-in-law” does not represent all “in-laws” in 2008. 

The same can be said of comparing the three categories of “biological” “step,” and “adopted” child in 2008 to “Child” in previous years. Before 2008, respondents may have considered anyone under 18 as “child” and chosen that category. The ACS includes “foster child” as a category. However, the 2010 Census did not contain this category, and “foster children” were included in the “Other nonrelative” category. Therefore, comparison of “foster child” cannot be made to the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2013, the “spouse” category includes same-sex spouses.

 - Dataset: Smart Streetlight RFI Responses: ##Overview

This guide to the City of Pittsburgh Smart Streetlight Request for Information (RFI) was created to provide clarity and transparency to the ongoing Smart Streetlight project in the City of Pittsburgh. 

Pittsburgh has approximately 40,000 City-owned and operated streetlights, the vast majority of which are traditional high-pressure sodium HID luminaires controlled by simple photocell units. Due to high energy and maintenance costs, the City is developing a plan to replace the bulk of this system with remotely managed LED luminaires, with the goal being a potential energy savings of 60-80%. These savings can finance the conversion program through an Energy Savings Performance Contract. The City has previously piloted this approach in 2012, upgrading 4,500 luminaires through a State-funded energy savings program.  

The City recognizes that updated streetlights can offer a ready-made physical and communications platform for the sensors, controls and backhaul that power a Smart City. In the case of a Smart Streetlight deployment however, the problem is not pre-defined, so it is unclear what the City may actually need. This is why the City chose to release an RFI instead of the more common Request for Proposals (RFP), in order to understand the state of the industry, perform a market analysis and provide a learning experience for City personnel.  This RFI was designed to help the City understand the industry's perspective on these emerging technologies while providing a more efficient and equitable lighting system. 

The City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget released the Smart Streetlights RFI on March 2nd, 2017 and closed it on April 10th, 2017.  The City received twenty-five responses from different businesses who offered a wide variety of services, products and concepts. All of the responses, as well as the RFI itself and the resulting questions and answers, are available to view.

##"Smart Cities"

The term "Smart City" refers to a range of technologies designed to sense and control various real-world phenomena, and software design and development projects to collect, present and administer those technologies' data and functions. 

##LEDs

LEDs have a higher efficiency in their conversion of electricity to light. LEDs also last much longer than sodium lamps. They also allow for fine-tuned control to maximize energy savings and performance.

 - Dataset: Pittsburgh Neighborhood Atlas, 1977: This compilation includes five historical datasets that are part of the University of Pittsburgh Library collection. The datasets were transcribed from The Pittsburgh Neighborhood Atlas, published in 1977. The atlas was prepared by the Pittsburgh Neighborhood Alliance.  The information provides an insight into the neighborhoods conditions and the direction in which they were moving at the time of preparation. Much of the material describing neighborhood characteristics came from figures compiled for smaller areas: voting districts or census blocks.
The five datasets in this collection provide data about overall neighborhood satisfaction and satisfaction with public services, based on a city-wide citizen survey. Also included are statistics about public assistance, the crime rate and the changes in real estate and mortgage loans transactions.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Smoking Rates: Smoking rates for each Census Tract in Allegheny County were produced for the study “Developing small-area predictions for smoking and obesity prevalence in the United States.” The data is not explicitly based on population surveys or data collection conducted in Allegheny County, but rather estimated using statistical modeling techniques. In this technique, researchers applied the smoking rate of a demographically similar Census Tract to one in Allegheny County to compute a smoking rate.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Fast Food Establishments: The Allegheny County Health Department has generated this list of fast food restaurants by exporting all chain restaurants without an alcohol permit from the County’s Fee and Permit System. A chain restaurant defined by the County is any restaurant that has more than one location in the County. Chain restaurants capture both local and national chains (including locally owned national chains) so long as there is one or more establishments in operation within the County.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Tobacco Vendors: The tobacco vendor information provides the location of all tobacco vendors in Allegheny County in 2015. Data was compiled from administrative records managed by the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Housing Tenure: Home ownership provides a number of financial, social, and health benefits to American families. Especially in areas with housing price appreciation, home ownership is a wealth building mechanism and homeowners are also eligible to receive substantial federal and local tax benefits. Owning a home also provides families with increased residential stability, which can translate into improved school performance for children. The financial stake owners have in their neighborhood also is viewed as something that spurs them to become more-engaged in their community, and there is some research that has found that home ownership also can translate to improved health. The National Association of Realtors has compiled a summary of research related to the benefits of home ownership.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Particulate Matter 2.5: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency provides information on the particulate matter concentration for Allegheny County that have a diameter greater or equal to 2.5 mm. The data is based on a combination of 2012 model and monitor data reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Air and Radiation. The data represents the mean PM 2.5 measurement in micrograms per cubic meter for each census tract in Allegheny County. This data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Environmental Protection’s Environmental Justice Screen tool.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Poor Housing Conditions: This estimate of the percent of distressed housing units in each Census Tract was prepared using data from the American Community Survey and the Allegheny County Property Assessment database. The estimate was produced by the Reinvestment Fund in their work with the Allegheny County Department of Economic Development.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Obesity Rates: Obesity rates for each Census Tract in Allegheny County were produced for the study “Developing small-area predictions for smoking and obesity prevalence in the United States." The data is not explicitly based on population surveys or data collection conducted in Allegheny County, but rather estimated using statistical modeling techniques. In this technique, researchers applied the obesity rate of a demographically similar census tract to one in Allegheny County to compute an obesity rate.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Clean Indoor Air Act Exemptions: List and location of all the businesses and social clubs who have received an exemption from the Pennsylvania Clean Indoor Air Act. “The Clean Indoor Air Act, Act 27 of 2008, was signed into law on June 13, 2008. The legislation prohibits smoking in a public place or a workplace and lists examples of what is considered a public place. The bill allows for some exceptions, including a private residence (except those licensed as a child care facility), a private social function where the site involved is under the control of the sponsor (except where the site is owned , leased, or operated by a state or local government agency) and a wholesale or retail tobacco shop. It also imposes penalties for those establishments in noncompliance, as well as those individuals smoking in prohibited areas.”
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Greenways: Greenways data was compiled by the Allegheny Land Trust as a planning effort in the development of Allegheny Places, the Allegheny County Comprehensive Plan. The plan was published in 2008.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Vacant Properties: Mail carriers routinely collect data on address no longer receiving mail due to vacancy. This vacancy data is reported quarterly at census tract geographies in the United States for residential, commercial, and industrial properties along with counts of total mailing addresses. Data released through DASH has been aggregated to Allegheny County Municipalities and City Wards.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Walk Scores: Walk Score measures the walkability of any address using a patented system developed by the Walk Score company. For each 2010 Census Tract centroid, Walk Score analyzed walking routes to nearby amenities. Points are awarded based on the distance to amenities in each category. Amenities within a 5 minute walk (.25 miles) are given maximum points. A decay function is used to give points to more distant amenities, with no points given after a 30 minute walk.
Walk Score also measures pedestrian friendliness by analyzing population density and road metrics such as block length and intersection density. Data sources include Google, Education.com, Open Street Map, the U.S. Census, Localeze, and places added by the Walk Score user community.
 - Dataset: Allegheny County Environmental Justice Areas: Environmental Justice areas in this guide have been defined by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The Department defines an environmental justice area as any census tract where at least 20 percent of the population lives in poverty, and/or 30 percent or more of the population is minority.

 - Dataset: LEGO Diorama Images: We often create dioramas from LEGO bricks for use with our presentations, blogs, and social media posts. We find it's much more fun and effective to reenact meetings and other scenes than to try and use real-life images.  It also saves us from the hassle of worrying about receiving permission to use a person's photo in our work. By popular demand, we have released some of our favorite images as open data for you to use.
 - Dataset: State of Aging in Allegheny County Survey: For more than three decades UCSUR has documented the status of older adults in the County along multiple life domains.  Every decade we issue a comprehensive report on aging in Allegheny County and this report represents our most recent effort.  It documents important shifts in the demographic profile of the population in the last three decades, characterizes the current status of the elderly in multiple life domains, and looks ahead to the future of aging in the County.  This report is unique in that we examine not only those aged 65 and older, but also the next generation old persons, the Baby Boomers.  Collaborators on this project include the Allegheny County Area Agency on Aging, the United Way of Allegheny County, and the Aging Institute of UPMC Senior Services and the University of Pittsburgh.

 The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive analysis of aging in Allegheny County.  To this end, we integrate survey data collected from a representative sample of older county residents with secondary data available from Federal, State, and County agencies to characterize older individuals on multiple dimensions, including demographic change and population projections, income, work and retirement, neighborhoods and housing, health, senior service use, transportation, volunteering, happiness and life satisfaction, among others.  Since baby boomers represent the future of aging in the County we include data for those aged 55-64 as well as those aged 65 and older.
 - Dataset: A Community Profile of Pittsburgh Neighborhoods, 1974: These data include four historical datasets that were transcribed from the Community Profiles of Pittsburgh reports, which were published in 1974.

 - Dataset: Market Value Analysis - Urban Redevelopment Authority: In late 2016, the URA, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2016 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for the City of Pittsburgh. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies. 

Pittsburgh’s 2016 MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market between July, 2013 and June, 2016:

•	Median Sales Price

•	Variance of Sales Price

•	Percent Households Owner Occupied

•	Density of Residential Housing Units

•	Percent Rental with Subsidy

•	Foreclosures as a Percent of Sales

•	Permits as a Percent of Housing Units

•	Percent of Housing Units Built Before 1940

•	Percent of Properties with Assessed Condition “Poor” or worse

•	Vacant Housing Units as a Percentage of Habitable Units

The MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

During the research process, staff from the URA and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.
