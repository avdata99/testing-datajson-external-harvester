 - Dataset: Alternative Fuels Data Center: Find alternative fueling stations near an address or ZIP code or along a route in the United States. Enter a state to see a station count.  ## Data Collection Methods ##  The data in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator are gathered and verified through a variety of methods. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) obtains information about new stations from trade media, Clean Cities coordinators, an Add a Station form on the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) website, and through collaborating with infrastructure equipment and fuel providers.  NREL regularly compares its station data with those of other relevant trade organizations and websites. Differences in methodologies and inclusion criteria may result in slight differences between NREL's database and those maintained by other organizations. NREL also collaborates with alternative fuel industry groups to maintain the data. NREL and its data collection subcontractor are currently collaborating with natural gas, electric drive, biodiesel, ethanol, and propane industry groups to establish best practices for identifying new stations in the most-timely manner possible and to develop a more rigorous network for the future.  ## Station Update Schedule ##  Existing stations in the database are contacted at least once a year on an established schedule to verify they are still operational and dispensing the fuel specified. Based on an established data collection schedule, the database is updated once a month with the exception of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) data, which are updated twice a month. Stations that are no longer operational or no longer provide alternative fuel are removed from the database on a monthly basis or as they are identified.  ## Mapping and Counting Methods ##  Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. A station appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of fuel dispensers or charging outlets at that location. Station addresses are geocoded and mapped using an automatic geocoding application. The geocoding application returns the most accurate location based on the provided address. Station locations may also be provided by external sources (e.g., station operators) and/or verified in a geographic information system (GIS) tool like Google Earth, Google Maps, or Google StreetView. This information is considered highly accurate, and these coordinates override any information generated using the geocoding application.  ## Notes about Specific Station Types ## ### Private Stations ### Stations with an Access of "Private - Fleet customers only" may allow other entities to fuel through a business-to-business arrangement. For more information, fleet customers should refer to the information listed in the details section for that station to contact the station directly.  ### Biodiesel Stations ### The Alternative Fueling Station Locator only includes stations offering biodiesel blends of 20% (B20) and above.  ### Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) ### An electric charging station, or EVSE, appears as one point on the map, regardless of the number of charging outlets at that location. The number and type of charging outlets available are displayed as additional details when the station location is selected. Each point on the map is counted as one station in the station count. To see a total count of EVSE for all outlets available, go to the Alternative Fueling Station Counts by State table. Residential EVSE locations are not included in the Alternative Fueling Station Locator.  ## Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Propane) Stations ### Because many propane stations serve customers other than drivers and fleets, NREL collaborated with the industry to effectively represent the differences. Each propane station is designated as a 'primary' or 'secondary' service type. Both types are able to fuel vehicles. However, locations with a 'primary' designation offer vehicle services and fuel priced specifically for use in vehicles. The details page for each station lists its service designation.

 - Dataset: Building Component Library: The Building Component Library (BCL) is the U.S. Department of Energy's comprehensive online searchable library of energy modeling building blocks and descriptive metadata. Novice users and seasoned practitioners can use the freely available and uniquely identifiable components to create energy models and cite the sources of input data, which will increase the credibility and reproducibility of their simulations.  The BCL contains components which are the building blocks of an energy model. They can represent physical characteristics of the building such as roofs, walls, and windows, or can refer to related operational information such as occupancy and equipment schedules and weather information. Each component is identified through a set of attributes that are specific to its type, as well as other metadata such as provenance information and associated files.  The BCL also contains energy conservation measures (ECM), referred to as measures, which describe a change to a building and its associated model. For the BCL, this description attempts to define a measure for reproducible application, either to compare it to a baseline model, to estimate potential energy savings, or to examine the effects of a particular implementation.  The BCL currently contains more than 30,000 components and measures. A faceted search mechanism has been implemented on the BCL that allows users to filter through the search results using various facets. Facet categories include component and measure types, data source, and energy modeling software type. All attributes of a component or measure can also be used to filter the results.

 - Dataset: Energy Innovation Portal: About the Energy Innovation Portal.  The Energy Innovation Portal is a one-stop resource for Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. This application enables users to locate technologies developed with DOE funding and available for licensing. These technologies can be viewed as marketing summaries, which provide business friendly descriptions of the technology, or the patent itself. When you find a technology you are interested in, simply fill out the contact form to get directly in touch with the licensing representative from each laboratory.  Creation of the Energy Innovation Portal.  In its proposal to manage the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC came up with the concept for an Intellectual Portal (IP Portal). The IP Portal was to be a single source for national laboratories, and other stakeholders (such as university partners) to post high quality marketing summaries with the hope of increasing licensing deal flow. Many times, potential licensees of laboratory technology had mentioned the difficulty that they experienced while searching for licensing opportunities. The Energy Innovation Portal (the new name of the IP Portal) was designed to help alleviate this concern, and to simultaneously improve the opportunities for cross-lab intellectual property (IP) bundling.  NREL, initially in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute, created the technical architecture and executed the software development for the Energy Innovation Portal, including the selection and integration of more than 50 software applications. The Java-based website employs a MySQL relational database management system and includes a search engine tuned to meet the needs of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. NREL oversaw the initial development, and executed the subsequent improvements, of a customized software script to automatically populate the MySQL database with more than 16,000 DOE-created patents and patent applications. The data was sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from DOE national laboratories are filed under the names of their managing organizations for NREL, it was previously the Midwest Research Institute and is now the Alliance for Sustainable Energy but an improved algorithm associated laboratory contract number and management organizations to the laboratories themselves, allowing users to find the relevant patents by simply searching for "NREL" or the names of the other national labs.  Licensing DOE Technologies.  As research performed within the DOE National Laboratories develops into promising discoveries, patents are pursued to protect the intellectual property. For-profit entities can leverage DOE investments in early-stage and applied research by licensing these intellectual properties to develop the technology toward commercial application.  The licensing process is slightly different across national laboratories, so contact the licensing representative listed at the bottom of each marketing summary to discuss your options and start the process.

 - Dataset: Federal Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Performance: The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides progress data tables illustrating Federal agency progress in meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets established under Executive Order (E.O.) 13514, as well as the comprehensive greenhouse gas inventories as reported by the Federal agencies:  - Federal Agency Progress Toward Reduction TargetsMicrosoft Excel: View overall government and Federal agency reductions in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions categories. - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. Includes all greenhouse gas emissions as reported by Federal agencies, including emissions from sources not subject to the reduction targets. - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2011 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2010 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2008  Fiscal year (FY) 2009 inventories are not available because FY 2010 was the first year agencies were required to report under E.O. 13514. FY 2008 base year inventories were also reported at that time.  ### Federal GHG Requirements Overview ###  E.O. 13514 required Federal agencies to set individual targets for reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. When all agency targets are combined, the overall target for the entire Federal Government is a 28% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. GHG emissions from certain types of activities are not subject to the reduction targets, including emissions from generation of electric power sold to others and from fuels used in excluded vehicles and equipment (such as tactical, combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight operations).  Similarly, separate targets were established for indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions with a combined Federal Government target of a 13% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. Read the White House Council on Environmental Quality's Guidance for Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Inventories under E.O. 13515.

An industrial assessment is, quite simply, an in-depth assessment of a plant site; its facilities, services and manufacturing operations. This term is used to refer to a process which involves a thorough examination of potential savings from:    - energy efficiency improvements   - waste minimization and pollution prevention   - productivity improvement  Assessments are performed by local teams of engineering faculty and students from 24 centers and 32 participating universities across the country.  The assessment begins with a university-based IAC team conducting a survey of the eligible plant, followed by a one or two day site visit, taking engineering measurements as a basis for assessment recommendations. The team then performs a detailed analysis for specific recommendations with related estimates of costs, performance and payback times.  Within 60 days, a confidential report, detailing the analysis, findings and recommendations of the team is sent to the plant. In two to six months, follow-up phone calls are placed to the plant manager to verify recommendations that will be implemented.

Projects can be either on the customer side of the utility meter, buying and selling electricity at retail rates, or on the utility side of the meter, selling electricity at a price negotiated through a power purchase agreement (PPA).
 - Dataset: The Open PV Project: Open PV Project is a collaborative effort between government, industry, and the public that is compiling a comprehensive database of photovoltaic (PV) installation data for the United States. Data for the project are voluntarily contributed from a variety of sources including utilities, installers, and the general public. The data collected is actively maintained by the contributors and are always changing to provide an evolving, up-to-date snapshot of the US solar power market. Data Collection. The Open PV Project is collecting data from any willing contributor of available information. NREL has "seeded" the Open PV database by requesting data from most state run incentive programs, large utilities, and other organizations. This initial data collection has provided a solid base of data for the project to launch from and it is our hope that the database will continue to grow through contributions from the PV community and anyone interested in understanding PV market dynamics in the US.  Data Quality. Determining the quality of incoming data is dependent upon who is submitting the data to the project. This means that data coming from users associated with a particular organization may be "trusted" more than data from other unknown users. Each registered user is assigned a default "score" based on their organizational affiliation. This score is highest for Government users (State, Federal, etc.) because such users are often involved with incentive programs that have a defined data collection process in place. Second are utility and PV installers (and others in the PV industry), and so on. All users who contribute data to the project have the ability to gain a "project reputation" that can impact the score of the data they contribute.  Validation.  Data validation occurs on each record in the database on a regular basis. The database is continually analyzed for corrupt records, bad or invalid data, and outliers such as an abnormal cost to watt ratio. Records found to contain questionable data are flagged and are dealt with on a case by case basis by a member of the Open PV Team.  Duplication.  Understanding duplication is one of the ways that individual records are validated. In a publicly contributed database, it is imperative to anticipate the submission of duplicate records. When duplicate records are detected, they are added to an install specific list of duplicates and the data provided are aggregated into "summary records" of their respective installs. Identifying duplicate records helps validate PV installs in the database. The more a PV installation is duplicated in the database, the more trust the project places on the data for that installation.  Data Fields. Required Fields. The Open PV Project is designed to be able to store nearly any type of information pertaining to PV installations. In order to provide the primary statistics from the database we have identified 4 data fields that are required of each PV install added to the project. These four fields are:  -  Date Installed (Completion date or interconnection date) -  Size/Capacity of the PV Installation (in kW DC) -  Location (Zipcode or Street Address) -  Total Installed Cost (in USD, before incentives). Additional Fields. The four required fields listed above provide the Open PV Project with the base information needed to derive several key statistics on the US PV market, including historical trends and regional comparisons. However, the design of the Open PV database is capable of storing nearly any type of data associated with PV installation, so the Open PV Team would like to encourage you to contribute any additional information you are comfortable sharing. This extra information can be extremely valuable, for example, data that contains information about who installed the PV installation can help to answer very useful questions about where certain installers are working. Information on module or inverter types can be useful in mapping efficiency and detailed financing information can be a key factor in understanding trends in overall installation cost. The Open PV Team strongly encourages you to contribute any data you feel comfortable providing, especially data you would like to see visualized in our gallery someday.

The data provided are the representations certified to DOE by manufacturers and their third party representatives. DOE makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of the data. A note for parties that have submitted certification data: The public certification database has no legal significance. When a certification report is submitted in CCMS, the system automatically sends out an email confirmation of the submittal, which is the submitter's proof of having submitted the certification report to the Department. The regulatory requirement is fulfilled upon submission of a certification report that complies with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 429 - not upon posting on this site.
 - Dataset: Wind Energy Resource Data: NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States, with a resolution of 1/3 degree of latitude by 1/4 degree of longitude.  The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic/meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.  The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1/4 degree of latitude by 1/3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.

 - Dataset: Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey: The Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) is a national sample survey that collects information on the stock of U.S. commercial buildings, their energy-related building characteristics, and their energy consumption and expenditures. Commercial buildings include all buildings in which at least half of the floorspace is used for a purpose that is not residential, industrial, or agricultural, so they include building types that might not traditionally be considered "commercial," such as schools, correctional institutions, and buildings used for religious worship. The CBECS was first conducted in 1979; the eighth, and most recent survey, was conducted in 2003. CBECS is currently conducted on a quadrennial basis.

Radiochemistry analysis typically reports the presence of specific radionuclides measured as total activity or as either activity/unit of mass or activity/unit of volume, depending upon the sample media. In addition, total beta and total alpha activity may be reported. Currently, air filter and soil sample analysis results may be downloaded through the data repository. Both data sets are similar; they contain a number of columns describing the collected sample as well as the results of radiochemical analysis. In addition, there are a number of special fields that are specific to a given sample type; e.g. Air Filters specify the filter type and total volume, while soil samples specify the sample weight. For convenience, the sample information and subsequent analysis has been "flattened" into a simple tabular format. Consequently, if a sample has multiple analysis results the "sample collection" values will be repeated through the set; e.g., sample ID#, barcode, latitude/longitude, collection date etc. To be included in the data repository, a given sample must meet the following criteria: has a valid latitude, longitude, and collection date; has been sent to a laboratory for analysis, or had analysis performed in the field; has at least one valid analysis result with a reportable unit, nuclide, and activity which has been validated by an authorized laboratory staff member.

### Project: Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2
The Wind Forecast Improvement Project in Complex Terrain, or **WFIP2**, field campaign officially ended on March 31, 2017. However, some instruments continued to collect data in the field after this date. In general, the data collected after March 31, 2017 have not been quality controlled (QC) and exist on the DAP as **z0** data. These data should only be used after discussions with the instrument owners. If any of these data have undergone QC, they will exist as **b0** data.

The WFIP2 has maintained two overarching scientific goals:

  1.	To improve the physical understanding of atmospheric processes that directly affect wind energy forecasts in areas of complex terrain.  
  2.	To incorporate the new understanding into a foundational weather forecasting model that improves wind energy forecasts.

### Project: Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI NREL-NASA Ames Wind Tunnel Experiment
The Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment (UAE) was undertaken to acquire research-grade wind turbine aerodynamics measurements capable of expanding physical comprehension, improving predictive models, and advancing turbine technology and performance. Initiated in 1987 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), the UAE evolved through five phases of field experiments during 1987 through 1998.[1-3] Concurrently, analogous wind turbine field experiments aimed at the same objectives were pursued at several laboratories in Europe and Asia.[4,5] Together, these field experiments succeeded in developing procedures and instrumentation for acquiring research-grade measurements in the field test environment and generally confirmed that turbine blades produced flow fields that were highly three-dimensional, strongly separated, and predominantly unsteady.

However, crucial details of the turbine blade flow fields remained obscure, overwhelmed by the temporal and spatial disparities imposed by turbulent atmospheric inflows. To isolate the key blade and rotor fluid mechanics details, atmospheric inflow anomalies needed to be eliminated. Thus, plans were launched simultaneously in the United States and Europe to carry out research-grade turbine aerodynamics experiments in the largest U.S. and EU wind tunnels. Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

The DAP UAE6 database contains the measurements acquired via experiments in the NASA Ames 80 ft x 120 ft during 2000. The UAE Phase VI wind tunnel experiment objectives were to: 1) acquire research grade aerodynamic and structural measurements 2) on a subscale wind turbine geometrically/dynamically similar to full scale, 3) operating in a controlled, low-turbulence inflow environment.

Sequence F: Downwind High Cone (F)

This test sequence used a downwind, rigid turbine with an 18° cone angle. The wind speed
ranged from 10 m/s to 20 m/s. Excessive inertial loading due to the high cone angle prevented
operation at lower wind speeds. Yaw angles of ±20° were achieved. The blade tip pitch was 3°.
The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure measurements were collected. The teeter
dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels were flagged as not applicable by
setting the measured values in the data file to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link was replaced with a
shorter bar so the load cell was not installed during this test. However, the teeter link load cell channel was flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to
-99999.99 N.

### Project: Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI NREL-NASA Ames Wind Tunnel Experiment
The Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment (UAE) was undertaken to acquire research-grade wind turbine aerodynamics measurements capable of expanding physical comprehension, improving predictive models, and advancing turbine technology and performance. Initiated in 1987 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), the UAE evolved through five phases of field experiments during 1987 through 1998.[1-3] Concurrently, analogous wind turbine field experiments aimed at the same objectives were pursued at several laboratories in Europe and Asia.[4,5] Together, these field experiments succeeded in developing procedures and instrumentation for acquiring research-grade measurements in the field test environment and generally confirmed that turbine blades produced flow fields that were highly three-dimensional, strongly separated, and predominantly unsteady.

However, crucial details of the turbine blade flow fields remained obscure, overwhelmed by the temporal and spatial disparities imposed by turbulent atmospheric inflows. To isolate the key blade and rotor fluid mechanics details, atmospheric inflow anomalies needed to be eliminated. Thus, plans were launched simultaneously in the United States and Europe to carry out research-grade turbine aerodynamics experiments in the largest U.S. and EU wind tunnels. Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

The DAP UAE6 database contains the measurements acquired via experiments in the NASA Ames 80 ft x 120 ft during 2000. The UAE Phase VI wind tunnel experiment objectives were to: 1) acquire research grade aerodynamic and structural measurements 2) on a subscale wind turbine geometrically/dynamically similar to full scale, 3) operating in a controlled, low-turbulence inflow environment.

### Dataset Overview
Sequences 8 and 9: Downwind Sonics (F,P) and Downwind Sonics Parked
(P)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Yaw angles of 0° to 60° were achieved. The blade tip pitch was 3°. The
rotor rotated at 72 RPM during Sequence 8, but it was parked during Sequence 9. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were removed and the plugs were installed.
Plastic tape 0.03-mm-thick was used to smooth the interface between the plugs and the blade. The
teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels were flagged as not
applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load
cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. During post-processing, the probe channels were set to read
-99999.99.

Sonic anemometers were mounted on a strut downwind of the turbine. The strut was mounted to
the T-frame, which was rotated to align the anemometers aft of the 9% and 49% radius locations
at hub height. Because of this configuration, the tunnel balance data are considered invalid.
Sequence 9 was designed to compare the downwind sonic anemometer readings with the upwind
sonic anemometers without interference from the turbine. The rotor was parked with the
instrumented blade at 0° azimuth. All pressure measurements obtained in Sequence 9 are invalid
because sufficient time for temperature stabilization did not occur, thus all associated data values
were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to 0.0000 Pa. This
test is further described in Appendix G.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence 6: Shroud Wake Measure (P)

This test sequence used a downwind, rigid turbine with a 3.4° cone angle. The wind speeds for
this sequence corresponded to subcritical [7 m/s], transitional [15 m/s], and supercritical [20 m/s]
Reynolds number regimes for the circular cross-section tower. The yaw angle and blade tip pitch
angles were selected to traverse the probe tip across the tower wake while keeping the probe axis
approximately parallel to the tunnel centerline. The rotor was parked with the instrumented blade
at 180° azimuth. Blade and probe pressure measurements were collected.

An airfoil-shaped aluminum shroud was placed on the tower below the 34% span five-hole probe. It
extended below the 91% span five-hole probe. The turntable angle was adjusted to position the
shroud at various angles relative to the flow.

Sequence V: Tip Plate (F)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 25 m/s, and the yaw angle was held at 0°. The blade pitch angle was 3°. The rotor
rotated at 72 RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were

the probe channels were set to read -99999.99. The standard tip blocks were replaced
with a tip plate to simulate the effect of an undeployed tip-mounted aerodynamic brake as shown
in Appendix A. Note that the blade radius was not changed during post-processing so the
pressure tap locations are at the same radial location, but the reference to 30% represents 30% of
5.029 m, not 4.943 m. Throughout this report, references to the blade span are made for the 5.029-

### Dataset Overview
Sequences S, T, and U: Upwind, No Probes (F); Upwind 2° Pitch (F);
Upwind 4° Pitch (F)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Yaw angles of 0° to 180° were achieved for Sequence S, but the yaw angle
remained at 0° for Sequences T and U. The blade tip pitch was 3° for Sequence S, 2° for
Sequence T, and 4° for Sequence U. These three sequences were interleaved during testing
because the pitch angle change was easily made by the turbine operator. The rotor rotated at 72
RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were removed and the
plugs were installed. Plastic tape 0.03-mm-thick was used to smooth the interface between the
plugs and the blade. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels
were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to -99999.99 Nm.
The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. During post-processing, the probe
channels were set to read -99999.99.

In addition to the standard 30-second campaigns, yaw sweeps were done at 7 m/s and 10 m/s for
the Sequence S configuration. These 6-minute campaigns were collected while the yaw drive
rotated the turbine 360° at a rate of 1°/s. The file names for these campaigns use the letter
designation, followed by two digits for wind speed, followed by YSU, followed by 00.

Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

The DAP UAE6 database contains the measurements acquired via experiments in the NASA Ames 80 ft x 120 ft during 2000. The UAE Phase VI wind tunnel experiment objectives were to: 1) acquire research grade aerodynamic and structural measurements 2) on a subscale wind turbine geometrically/dynamically similar to full scale, 3) operating in a controlled, low-turbulence inflow environment.

### Dataset Overview
Sequences S, T, and U: Upwind, No Probes (F); Upwind 2° Pitch (F);
Upwind 4° Pitch (F)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Yaw angles of 0° to 180° were achieved for Sequence S, but the yaw angle
remained at 0° for Sequences T and U. The blade tip pitch was 3° for Sequence S, 2° for
Sequence T, and 4° for Sequence U. These three sequences were interleaved during testing
because the pitch angle change was easily made by the turbine operator. The rotor rotated at 72
RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were removed and the
plugs were installed. Plastic tape 0.03-mm-thick was used to smooth the interface between the
plugs and the blade. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels
were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to -99999.99 Nm.
The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. During post-processing, the probe
channels were set to read -99999.99.

In addition to the standard 30-second campaigns, yaw sweeps were done at 7 m/s and 10 m/s for
the Sequence S configuration. These 6-minute campaigns were collected while the yaw drive
rotated the turbine 360° at a rate of 1°/s. The file names for these campaigns use the letter
designation, followed by two digits for wind speed, followed by YSU, followed by 00.

### Project: Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI NREL-NASA Ames Wind Tunnel Experiment
The Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment (UAE) was undertaken to acquire research-grade wind turbine aerodynamics measurements capable of expanding physical comprehension, improving predictive models, and advancing turbine technology and performance. Initiated in 1987 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), the UAE evolved through five phases of field experiments during 1987 through 1998.[1-3] Concurrently, analogous wind turbine field experiments aimed at the same objectives were pursued at several laboratories in Europe and Asia.[4,5] Together, these field experiments succeeded in developing procedures and instrumentation for acquiring research-grade measurements in the field test environment and generally confirmed that turbine blades produced flow fields that were highly three-dimensional, strongly separated, and predominantly unsteady.

However, crucial details of the turbine blade flow fields remained obscure, overwhelmed by the temporal and spatial disparities imposed by turbulent atmospheric inflows. To isolate the key blade and rotor fluid mechanics details, atmospheric inflow anomalies needed to be eliminated. Thus, plans were launched simultaneously in the United States and Europe to carry out research-grade turbine aerodynamics experiments in the largest U.S. and EU wind tunnels. Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

### Dataset Overview
Sequence R: Step AOA, No Probes (P)

This sequence was designed to quantify the effect of the five-hole probes on the 3-D blade static
angle-of-attack response in the presence of rotational influences by repeating Sequence K without
five-hole probes. This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind
speeds ranged from 6 m/s to 20 m/s, and data were collected at yaw angles of 0° and 30°. The
rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were
removed and the plugs were installed. Plastic tape 0.03-mm-thick was used to smooth the
interface between the plugs and the blade. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and
these two channels were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file
to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. During post-processing,
the probe channels were set to read –99999.99.

The blade pitch angle ramped continuously at 0.18°/s over a wide range of increasing and
decreasing pitch angles. A step sequence was also performed. The blade pitch was stepped 5°; the
flow was allowed to stabilize; and the pitch angle was held for 5 seconds. Then the pitch angle
step was repeated. Again, a wide range of pitch angles was obtained, both increasing and
decreasing. The file lengths for this sequence varied from 96 seconds to 6 minutes, depending on
the pitch angle range. Some short points were collected at 0° yaw and 3° pitch to ascertain the
functionality of the instrumentation and repeatability over time. The file name convention used
the initial letter R, followed by two digits specifying wind speed, followed by two digits for yaw
angle, followed by RU, RD, or ST, followed by the repetition digit. The angle of attack motion
was differentiated by RU (ramp up), RD (ramp down), and ST (step down, then step up). This
sequence is related to Sequences K and L.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence P: Wake Flow Visualization, Upwind (P)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 15 m/s. Yaw angles of 0° to –60° were achieved. The blade tip pitch was 3°. The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure measurements were collected. The teeter
dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels were flagged as not applicable by
setting the measured values in the data file to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was
pre-tensioned to 40,000 N.

The aluminum blade tip designed to contain a smoke generator was installed, and counterweights
were installed in the non-instrumented blade tip to compensate. The turbine was positioned at the
appropriate yaw angle, and the smoke generator was ignited remotely. The campaign duration
was 3 minutes for all tests except P1000000, which was 2 minutes. The file name convention was
the standard format except for P10000A0, which indicated a 3° pitch angle. File P1000000 used a
12° pitch angle. After these two campaigns were collected, it was determined that all subsequent
data should be collected with a 3° pitch angle. Pressure data were not acquired during this
sequence, so all associated data values were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured
values in the data file to 0.000 Pa. Corresponding pressure data are available from Sequence H for
the 3° pitch angle test points. Flow visualization data obtained from wall- and ceiling-mounted
video cameras were recorded to videotape. The camera locations and calibration procedures are
described in Appendix J.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence O: Sin AOA, Parked (P)

This sequence was designed to quantify the blade 3-D unsteady aerodynamic response in the
absence of rotational influences by varying blade pitch angle. This test sequence used an upwind,
rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged from 18.9 m/s to 39.3 m/s, and the yaw
angle was 0° throughout the sequence. The rotor was parked with the instrumented blade fixed at
0° azimuth, and the rotor lock was installed (see Appendix A). Blade and probe pressure
measurements were collected. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two
channels were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to
-99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N.

Sinusoidal angle-of-attack histories were designed to emulate 2-D S809 dynamic data obtained at
the OSU wind tunnel (Reuss Ramsey et al. 1995) as well as 1P yawed flow angle-of-attack
variations the turbine could be expected to encounter in routine operation. The reduced frequency
(K), mean angle of attack (αm), and oscillation amplitude (αω) were computed for each of the five
primary span locations. The file lengths varied according to the time required to complete 40
oscillations at the specified frequency. The file name convention used the sequence designation
O, followed by two digits for the span location (30, 47, 80, or 95), followed by two digits
representing the condition specified in the test matrix, followed by the repetition digit. Due to
time constraints, the test conditions corresponding to the 63% span location were eliminated. Test points with a static pitch angle of 3° were collected
throughout the sequence to ascertain instrumentation fidelity.

Test sequence M used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged from
5 m/s to 15 m/s. Yaw angles ranged from 0° to 90°. The blade tip pitch was 3°. The rotor rotated
at 72 RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were removed and

plugs and the blade. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels
were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to –99999.99 Nm.
The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. During post-processing, the probe
channels were set to read –99999.99. Zigzag tape was installed near the leading edge of the
instrumented blade on both the upper and lower surfaces as described in Appendix K.
In addition to the standard 30-second campaigns, yaw sweeps were done at 7 m/s and 10 m/s.
These 90-second campaigns were collected while the yaw drive rotated the turbine 90° at a rate of
1°/s. The file names for these campaigns use the letter designation, followed by two digits for
wind speed, followed by YSU, followed by 00.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence L: Step AOA, Parked (P)

This sequence was designed to quantify the 3-D blade static angle-of-attack response in the
absence of rotational influences by varying the blade pitch angle. This test sequence used an
upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. Wind speeds of 20 m/s and 30 m/s were used, and all
data were collected at a yaw angle of 0°. The rotor was parked with the instrumented blade fixed
at 0° azimuth, and the rotor lock was installed (see Appendix A). Blade and probe pressure
measurements were collected. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two
channels were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to
-99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N.

The blade pitch angle ramped continuously at 0.18°/s over a wide range of increasing and
decreasing pitch angles. A step sequence was also performed. The blade pitch was stepped 5°, the
flow was allowed to stabilize, and the pitch angle was held for 8 seconds. Then the pitch angle
step was repeated. Again, a wide range of pitch angles was obtained, both increasing and
decreasing. The file lengths for this sequence varied from 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the pitch
angle range. The file name convention used the initial letter L followed by two digits specifying
wind speed, followed by 00 for yaw angle, followed by RU, RD, or ST, followed by the repetition
digit. The angle-of-attack motion was differentiated by RU (ramp up), RD (ramp down), and ST
(step down, then step up). This sequence is related to sequences K and R.

### Project: Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI NREL-NASA Ames Wind Tunnel Experiment
The Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment (UAE) was undertaken to acquire research-grade wind turbine aerodynamics measurements capable of expanding physical comprehension, improving predictive models, and advancing turbine technology and performance. Initiated in 1987 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), the UAE evolved through five phases of field experiments during 1987 through 1998.[1-3] Concurrently, analogous wind turbine field experiments aimed at the same objectives were pursued at several laboratories in Europe and Asia.[4,5] Together, these field experiments succeeded in developing procedures and instrumentation for acquiring research-grade measurements in the field test environment and generally confirmed that turbine blades produced flow fields that were highly three-dimensional, strongly separated, and predominantly unsteady.

However, crucial details of the turbine blade flow fields remained obscure, overwhelmed by the temporal and spatial disparities imposed by turbulent atmospheric inflows. To isolate the key blade and rotor fluid mechanics details, atmospheric inflow anomalies needed to be eliminated. Thus, plans were launched simultaneously in the United States and Europe to carry out research-grade turbine aerodynamics experiments in the largest U.S. and EU wind tunnels. Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

### Dataset Overview
Sequence K: Step AOA, Probes (P)

This sequence was designed to quantify the 3-D blade static angle-of-attack response in the
presence of rotational influences by varying the blade pitch angle. Sequence K used an upwind,
rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speeds ranged from 6 m/s to 20 m/s, and data were
collected at yaw angles of 0° and 30°. The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure
measurements were collected. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two
channels were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to
-99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N.

The blade pitch angle ramped continuously at 0.18°/s over a wide range of increasing and

flow was allowed to stabilize, and the pitch angle was held for 8 seconds. Then the pitch angle step was repeated. Again, a wide range of pitch angles was obtained, both increasing and
decreasing. The file lengths for this sequence varied from 96 seconds to 6 minutes, depending on
the pitch angle range. Some short points were collected at 0° yaw and 3° pitch to verify the
functionality of the instrumentation. The file name convention used the initial letter K, followed
by two digits specifying wind speed, followed by two digits for yaw angle, followed by RU, RD,
or ST, followed by the repetition digit. The angle-of-attack motion was differentiated by RU
(ramp up), RD (ramp down), and ST (step down then step up). This sequence is related to

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Yaw angles of –30° to 180° were achieved at low wind speeds, and angles
of ±10° were achieved for high wind speeds. The blade tip pitch was 3° for sequence H, 0° for

In addition to the standard 30-second campaigns, yaw sweeps were done at 7 m/s and 10 m/s.
These 6-minute campaigns were collected while the yaw drive rotated the turbine 360° at a rate of
1°/s. The file names for these campaigns use the letter designation, followed by two digits for
wind speed, followed by YS, followed by 000.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence W: Extended Blade (F)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed ranged
from 5 m/s to 21 m/s, and the yaw angle was held at 0°. The blade pitch angle was 3°. The rotor
rotated at 72 RPM. Blade pressure measurements were collected. The five-hole probes were
removed and the plugs were installed. Plastic tape 0.03-mm thick was used to smooth the
interface between the plugs and the blade. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and
these two channels were flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file
to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load cell was pretensioned to 40,000 N. During postprocessing,
the probe channels were set to read –99999.99. The standard tip blocks were replaced
with blade extensions that created a 5.532-m radius rotor as shown in Appendix A. The extension
used the S809 airfoil throughout, and the linear taper of the blade continued along the extension.
Note that the blade radius was not changed during post-processing so the pressure tap locations
are at the same radial location, but the reference to 30% represents 30% of 5.029 m, not 5.532 m.
Throughout this report, references to the blade span are made for the 5.029-m radius, not the
5.532-m radius.

Sequence 5: Sweep Wind Speed (F,P)

This test sequence used an upwind, rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speed was
ramped from 5 m/s to 25 m/s by the wind tunnel operator. This was repeated with a decreasing
ramp. The yaw angle was maintained at 0°. The blade tip pitch was 3° or 6°. The rotor rotated at
72 RPM. Blade pressure and probe measurements were collected for both pitch angles. The five-hole
probes were removed and the plugs were installed for another 3° pitch case. Plastic tape 0.03

### Dataset Overview
Sequence Q: Dynamic Inflow (P)

This sequence was designed to characterize the dynamic inflow variation using the five-hole
probes that extend upwind of the leading edge of the blade. This test sequence used an upwind,
rigid turbine with a 0° cone angle. The wind speeds ranged from 5 m/s to 15 m/s, and data were
collected at a 0° yaw angle. The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure measurements
were collected. The teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels were
flagged as not applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to -99999.99 Nm. The
teeter link load cell was pretensioned to 40,000 N.
The blade pitch angle was changed from the initial tip pitch angle to the final tip pitch angle at the
maximum rate of 67°/s. This angle was maintained for the specified delay time duration. Then the
blade was pitched back to the initial pitch angle and held for the specified hold time. This was
repeated 20 times. The campaign at 15 m/s was aborted early due to excessive low-speed shaft
torque loads. The file length varied depending on the time required to obtain 20 pitch cycles for
the specified range of angles. The name convention was the standard format, except for the short
campaigns collected to ascertain the functionality of the instrumentation. These points were
collected at a 3° pitch angle and use the characters REF in the four digits that normally represent
yaw angle.

### Project: Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase VI NREL-NASA Ames Wind Tunnel Experiment
The Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment (UAE) was undertaken to acquire research-grade wind turbine aerodynamics measurements capable of expanding physical comprehension, improving predictive models, and advancing turbine technology and performance. Initiated in 1987 at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC), the UAE evolved through five phases of field experiments during 1987 through 1998.[1-3] Concurrently, analogous wind turbine field experiments aimed at the same objectives were pursued at several laboratories in Europe and Asia.[4,5] Together, these field experiments succeeded in developing procedures and instrumentation for acquiring research-grade measurements in the field test environment and generally confirmed that turbine blades produced flow fields that were highly three-dimensional, strongly separated, and predominantly unsteady.

However, crucial details of the turbine blade flow fields remained obscure, overwhelmed by the temporal and spatial disparities imposed by turbulent atmospheric inflows. To isolate the key blade and rotor fluid mechanics details, atmospheric inflow anomalies needed to be eliminated. Thus, plans were launched simultaneously in the United States and Europe to carry out research-grade turbine aerodynamics experiments in the largest U.S. and EU wind tunnels. Documented and archived in the DAP UAE6 database, the NREL UAE Phase VI experiment was conducted in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 80 ft x 120 ft wind tunnel at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California.[6] The EU Model rotor EXperiment In COntrolled conditions (MEXICO) experiment was carried out in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels (DNW) Large Low Speed Facility (LLF), located near Marknesse in The Netherlands.[7]

The DAP UAE6 database contains the measurements acquired via experiments in the NASA Ames 80 ft x 120 ft during 2000. The UAE Phase VI wind tunnel experiment objectives were to: 1) acquire research grade aerodynamic and structural measurements 2) on a subscale wind turbine geometrically/dynamically similar to full scale, 3) operating in a controlled, low-turbulence inflow environment.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence 4: Static Pressure Calibration (P)

This test sequence used a downwind, teetered turbine with a 3.4° cone angle. The wind speed
ranged from 5 m/s to 25 m/s. Yaw angles of 0° to 30° were achieved. The blade tip pitch was 3°.
The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure measurements were collected. A static
pitot probe was installed on a boom 2.3 m upwind of the nacelle at hub height and connected to
the reference side of the Mensor digital differential pressure transducer through the pneumatic
rotary coupling. This provided the reference pressure for all blade-mounted pressure transducers,
as opposed to the NASA atmospheric pressure reference that was used for all other test
sequences. This simulates the pressure system connections used in field measurements where the
static pressure was unknown.

### Dataset Overview
Sequence E: Yaw Releases (P)

This test sequence used a downwind, rigid turbine with a 3.4° cone angle. The wind speeds
ranged from 7 m/s to 17 m/s. Initial yaw angles of ±90° were achieved. The blade tip pitch was
3°. The rotor rotated at 72 RPM. Blade and probe pressure measurements were collected. The
teeter dampers were replaced with rigid links, and these two channels were flagged as not
applicable by setting the measured values in the data file to –99999.99 Nm. The teeter link load
cell was pre-tensioned to 40,000 N. The turbine was positioned at each specified yaw angle. A 30-
second data set was collected with the yaw brake engaged. These points used a letter for the last
digit beginning with A and proceeding through the alphabet as repeat points were needed. These
points were plotted and compared to ascertain the functionality of the instrumentation. The files
ending in numbers beginning with 0 and increasing with each repetition represent yaw release
points.

Once the fixed-position yaw test was complete, the yaw drive was engaged to hold the turbine.
The yaw brake was released, and the yaw drive was disabled allowing the turbine to yaw freely.
The yaw drive was disabled about 5 seconds into the campaign, and the turbine was allowed to
yaw freely for the rest of the 30-second duration. When the yaw drive is disabled, no torque is
applied to the motor, and the inertia and yawing force of the nacelle and rotor overcomes the
friction and inertia of the yaw gear and motor. The yaw releases were repeated five times at each
condition. Four additional campaigns were collected to determine the turbine’s natural yaw error
by releasing the brake at 0° yaw error. These file names use the E designation, followed by two
digits for wind speed, followed by XXXX, followed by the repetition digit.

REopt is a techno-economic decision support model used to determine the optimal selection, sizing, and dispatch strategy of candidate technologies such that site energy requirements are met at the minimum life-cycle cost. 

This tool allows the user to see how the optimized LCOE for different micro-grid configurations change as a wide range of input parameters vary. Available toggles include geographical location, fuel prices, discount rates, level of planned reliability, load profile, technology costs, distribution system costs, and other soft costs. Furthermore, a breakdown of the LCOE is provided showing how different cost components contribute to the final LCOE.  This tool can be used to obtain a better understanding of what cost-reflective tariffs in sub-Saharan micro-grid systems must be for different combinations of technical and economic project assumptions in order for developers to recover costs and attract investment. The modeled LCOE can also be compared to existing tariff structures and provide insight into the scale of subsidies and grants necessary to make micro-grid projects economically viable under current regulatory structures.

2. Microgrid Load Profile Explorer. The purpose of this tool is to provide hourly electrical load profiles for various household types (i.e., high income, medium income, and low income households) and for various commercial entities (i.e., water pumping for irrigation, grain milling, small shops, schools, clinics, and street lighting) that are commonly found in rural Sub-Saharan Africa. This tool allows the user to input the number of households, types of households, and number of commercial entities in order to see how the hourly electrical load profile changes and to see how the maximum and minimum electrical load changes. 
 - Dataset: Electrification Futures Study Technology Data: This data supplements the "Electrification Futures Study: End-Use Electric Technology Cost and Performance Projections through 2050" report.

 - Dataset: Distribution System Upgrade Unit Cost Database: This database contains unit cost information for different components that may be used to integrate distributed photovotaic (D-PV) systems onto distribution systems. Some of these upgrades and costs may also apply to integration of other distributed energy resources (DER). Which components are required, and how many of each, is system-specific and should be determined by analyzing the effects of distributed PV at a given penetration level on the circuit of interest in combination with engineering assessments on the efficacy of different solutions to increase the ability of the circuit to host additional PV as desired. The current state of the distribution system should always be considered in these types of analysis. 

The data in this database was collected from a variety of utilities, PV developers, technology vendors, and published research reports. Where possible, we have included information on the source of each data point and relevant notes. In some cases where data provided is sensitive or proprietary, we were not able to specify the source, but provide other information that may be useful to the user (e.g. year, location where equipment was installed). NREL has carefully reviewed these sources prior to inclusion in this database. 

Additional information about the database, data sources, and assumptions is included in the "Unit_cost_database_guide.doc" file included in this submission. This guide provides important information on what costs are included in each entry. Please refer to this guide before using the unit cost database for any purpose. 
 - Dataset: ATP3 Unified Field Study Data: ATP3 Unified Field Study DataThe Algae Testbed Public-Private Partnership ATP3 was established with the goal of investigating open pond algae cultivation across different geographic climatic seasonal and operational conditions while setting the benchmark for quality data collection analysis and dissemination. Identical algae cultivation systems and data analysis methodologies were established at testbed sites across the continental United States and Hawaii. Within this framework the Unified Field Studies UFS were designed to characterize the cultivation of different algal strains during all 4 seasons across this testbed network. The dataset presented here is the complete curated climatic cultivation harvest and biomass composition data for each season at each site.

 - Dataset: Maximum demand charge rates for commercial and industrial electricity tariffs in the United States: NREL has assembled a list of U.S. retail electricity tariffs and their associated demand charge rates for the Commercial and Industrial sectors. The data was obtained from the Utility Rate Database. Keep the following information in mind when interpreting the data:
(1) These data were interpreted and transcribed manually from utility tariff sheets, which are often complex. It is a certainty that these data contain errors, and therefore should only be used as a reference. Actual utility tariff sheets should be consulted if an action requires this type of data.
(2) These data only contains tariffs that were entered into the Utility Rate Database. Since not all tariffs are designed in a format that can be entered into the Database, this list is incomplete - it does not contain all tariffs in the United States.
(3) These data may have changed since this list was developed
(4) Many of the underlying tariffs have additional restrictions or requirements that are not represented here. For example, they may only be available to the agricultural sector or closed to new customers. 
(5) If there are multiple demand charge elements in a given tariff, the maximum demand charge is the sum of each of the elements at any point in time. Where tiers were present, the highest rate tier was assumed. The value is a maximum for the year, and may be significantly different from demand charge rates at other times in the year.

 - Dataset: Impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle charging on residential power demand - supplementary data: This data set is provided in support of a forthcoming paper: "Impact of uncoordinated plug-in electric vehicle charging on residential power demand," [1].

These files include electricity demand profiles for 200 households randomly selected among the ones available in the 2009 RECS data set for the Midwest region of the United States. The profiles have been generated using the modeling proposed by Muratori et al. [2], [3], that produces realistic patterns of residential power consumption, validated using metered data, with a resolution of 10 minutes. Households vary in size and number of occupants and the profiles represent total electricity use, in watts. 
The files also include in-home plug-in electric vehicle recharging profiles for 348 vehicles associated with the 200 households assuming both Level 1 (1920 W) and Level 2 (6600 W) residential charging infrastructure. The vehicle recharging profiles have been generated using the modeling proposed by Muratori et al. [4], that produces real-world recharging demand profiles, with a resolution of 10 minutes.

 - Dataset: Understanding the Evolution of Customer Motivations and Adoption Barriers in Residential Solar Markets: Survey Data: This research focused on accelerating solar photovoltaic (PV) diffusion by collecting new market data and developing predictive modeling frameworks to test and refine understandings of household level motivations for adopting solar. 

Three different household-level surveys were fielded: one for households who had installed PV on their current home or had signed a contract to do so (the Adopter survey), one for households that had seriously considered PV but had not installed it (the Considerer survey), and one for the general population who did not have PV on their current home (the general population survey or GPS).  Survey respondents were from four U.S. states: New Jersey, New York, Arizona, and California.  Details of recruiting and sampling are documented below.  

Research projects on residential PV adoption often collect data only from PV adopters or from the general population. One of the innovations of this project was the three-pronged household survey data collection. By collecting similar data from three fairly different "statuses" with respect to adoption, the surveys provide a basis for understanding how those who do not have rooftop PV differ from those who have, for how and why people do (or don't) transition from not having to having rooftop PV on their home, and for understanding the characteristics and viewpoints of households who have scarcely, or not at all, entered the "PV consideration" track. All three surveys covered single-family owner-occupied households in each of the four target states used in the project -- Arizona, California, New Jersey, and New York -  allowing a comparative approach to understanding how the factors that affect PV adoption vary by geography and policy conditions. 

The General Population and Considerer surveys provide a basis for understanding opinions about and interest in solar, and how these relate to household demographics and other conditions. Paired with the Adopter survey, they also provide data for understanding how those who do not have rooftop PV differ from those who have, and for how and why people do (or don't) transition from not having to having rooftop PV on their home. The Adopter survey questions were designed to capture a broad range of information on what motivates and impedes households to install rooftop PV, as well as the details and timing of the decision and installation. Survey instrument development drew from existing PV adoption survey instruments, PV adoption literature, and research team experience, as well as from past work on household interest in energy efficiency, environmental attitudes, purchasing tendencies, and related knowledge. Early interviews and discussions with installers and others in the PV industry were also taken into consideration.

 - Dataset: Metering Best Practices Applied in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's Research Support Facility: A Primer to the 2011 Measured and Modeled Energy Consumption Datasets: Modern buildings are complex energy systems that must be controlled for energy efficiency. The Research Support Facility (RSF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has hundreds of controllers -- computers that communicate with the building's various control systems -- to control the building based on tens of thousands of variables and sensor points. These control strategies were designed for the RSF's systems to efficiently support research activities. Many events that affect energy use cannot be reliably predicted, but certain decisions (such as control strategies) must be made ahead of time. NREL researchers modeled the RSF systems to predict how they might perform. They then monitor these systems to understand how they are actually performing and reacting to the dynamic conditions of weather, occupancy, and maintenance.

 - Dataset: Geothermal Exploration Cost and Time: The Department of Energy's Geothermal Technology Office (GTO) provides RD&D funding for geothermal exploration technologies with the goal of lowering the risks and costs of geothermal development and exploration. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was tasked with developing a metric in 2012 to measure the impacts of this RD&D funding on the cost and time required for exploration activities. The development of this cost and time metric included collecting cost and time data for exploration techniques, creating a baseline suite of exploration techniques to which future exploration cost and time improvements can be compared, and developing an online tool for graphically showing potential project impacts (all available at http://en.openei.org/wiki/Gateway: Geothermal). This paper describes the methodology used to define the baseline exploration suite of techniques (baseline), as well as the approach that was used to create the cost and time data set that populates the baseline. The resulting product, an online tool for measuring impact, and the aggregated cost and time data are available on the Open Energy Information website (OpenEI, http://en.openei.org) for public access.

 - Dataset: NREL Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL): Baseline Measurement System (BMS); Golden, Colorado (Data): The SRRL was established at the Solar Energy Research Institute (now NREL) in 1981 to provide continuous measurements of the solar resources, outdoor calibrations of pyranometers and pyrheliometers, and to characterize commercially available instrumentation. The SRRL is an outdoor laboratory located on South Table Mountain, a mesa providing excellent solar access throughout the year, overlooking Denver. Beginning with the basic measurements of global horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance and diffuse horizontal irradiance at 5-minute intervals, the SRRL Baseline Measurement System now produces more than 130 data elements at 1-min intervals that are available from the Measurement & Instrumentation Data Center Web site.  Data sources include global horizontal, direct normal, diffuse horizontal (from shadowband and tracking disk), global on tilted surfaces, reflected solar irradiance, ultraviolet, infrared (upwelling and downwelling), photometric and spectral radiometers, sky imagery, and surface meteorological conditions (temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, precipitation, snow cover, wind speed and direction at multiple levels). Data quality control and assessment include daily instrument maintenance (M-F) with automated data quality control based on real-time examinations of redundant instrumentation and internal consistency checks using NREL's SERI-QC methodology. Operators are notified of equipment problems by automatic e-mail messages generated by the data acquisition and processing system. Radiometers are recalibrated at least annually with reference instruments traceable to the World Radiometric Reference (WRR).

 - Dataset: Resource Reporting Methodology Analysis and Development of Geothermal Reporting Metric for GTO's Hydrothermal Program: The US Geological Survey (USGS) resource assessment (Williams et al., 2009) outlined a mean 30GWe of undiscovered hydrothermal resource in the western US. One goal of the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) is to accelerate the development of this undiscovered resource. The Geothermal Technologies Program (GTP) Blue Ribbon Panel (GTO, 2011) recommended that DOE focus efforts on helping industry identify hidden geothermal resources to increase geothermal capacity in the near term. Increased exploration activity will produce more prospects, more discoveries, and more readily developable resources. Detailed exploration case studies akin to those found in oil and gas (e.g. Beaumont, et al, 1990) will give operators a single point of information to gather clean, unbiased information on which to build geothermal drilling prospects. To support this effort, the National Renewable Energy laboratory (NREL) has been working with the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop a template for geothermal case studies on the Geothermal Gateway on OpenEI. In fiscal year 2013, the template was developed and tested with two case studies: Raft River Geothermal Area (http://en.openei.org/wiki/Raft_River_Geothermal_Area) and Coso Geothermal Area (http://en.openei.org/wiki/Coso_Geothermal_Area). In fiscal year 2014, ten additional case studies were completed, and additional features were added to the template to allow for more data and the direct citations of data. The template allows for: Data - a variety of data can be collected for each area, including power production information, well field information, geologic information, reservoir information, and geochemistry information. Narratives ? general (e.g. area overview, history and infrastructure), technical (e.g. exploration history, well field description, R&D activities) and geologic narratives (e.g. area geology, hydrothermal system, heat source, geochemistry.) Exploration Activity Catalog - catalog of exploration activities conducted in the area (with dates and references.) NEPA Analysis ? a query of NEPA analyses conducted in the area (that have been catalogued in the OpenEI NEPA database.) In fiscal year 2015, NREL is working with universities to populate additional case studies on OpenEI. The goal is to provide a large enough dataset to start conducting analyses of exploration programs to identify correlations between successful exploration plans for areas with similar geologic occurrence models.

 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Hawaii Low Resolution Concentrating Solar Power Resource: _Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for Hawaii.

_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for Hawaii. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.

_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximately 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. 
Units are in watt hours.

In this manuscript, we investigate biosorption as a potential means of recovering REEs from geothermal fluids, a low-grade but abundant REE source. We have previously engineered E. coli to express lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) on the cell surface and the resulting strain showed an increase in both REE adsorption capacity and selectivity. Here we examined how REE adsorption by the engineered E. coli is affected by various geochemical factors relevant to geothermal fluids, including total dissolved solids (TDS), temperature, pH, and the presence of competing trace metals.

 - Dataset: Graph Theory for Analyzing Pair-wise Data: Application to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Data: Graph theory is useful for estimating time-dependent model parameters via weighted least-squares using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. Plotting acquisition dates (epochs) as vertices and pair-wise interferometric combinations as edges defines an incidence graph. The edge-vertex incidence matrix and the normalized edge Laplacian matrix are factors in the covariance matrix for the pair-wise data. Using empirical measures of residual scatter in the pair-wise observations, we estimate the variance at each epoch by inverting the covariance of the pair-wise data. We evaluate the rank deficiency of the corresponding least-squares problem via the edge-vertex incidence matrix. We implement our method in a MATLAB software package called GraphTreeTA available on GitHub (https://github.com/feigl/gipht). We apply temporal adjustment to the data set described in Lu et al. (2005) at Okmok volcano, Alaska, which erupted most recently in 1997 and 2008. The data set contains 44 differential volumetric changes and uncertainties estimated from interferograms between 1997 and 2004. Estimates show that approximately half of the magma volume lost during the 1997 eruption was recovered by the summer of 2003. Between June 2002 and September 2003, the estimated rate of volumetric increase is (6.2 +/- 0.6) x 10^6 m^3/yr. Our preferred model provides a reasonable fit that is compatible with viscoelastic relaxation in the five years following the 1997 eruption. Although we demonstrate the approach using volumetric rates of change, our formulation in terms of incidence graphs applies to any quantity derived from pair-wise differences, such as wrapped phase or wrapped residuals.

Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory (HWRL) at Oregon State University in Fall of 2016.  Contains two zip files of raw data, one of project data, and a diagram of the device with dimensions. A "readme" file in the project data archive under "Docs" explains the project data.

 - Dataset: Advanced Control Systems for Wave Energy Converters: This submission contains several papers, a final report, descriptions of a theoretical framework for two types of control systems, and descriptions of eight real-time flap load control policies with the objective of assessing the potential improvement of annual average capture efficiency at a reference site on an MHK device developed by Resolute Marine Energy, Inc. (RME).  The submission also contains an LCOE model that estimates the performance and related energy cost improvements that each advanced control system might provide and recommendations for improving DOE's LCOE model.

The two types of control systems are for wave energy converters which transform data into commands that, in the case of RME's OWSC wave energy converter, provide real-time adjustments to damping forces applied to the prime mover via the power take-off system (PTO).  The control theories developed were:
1) Model Predictive Control (MPC) or so-called "non-causal" control whereby sensors deployed seaward of a wave energy converter measure incoming wave characteristics and transmit that information to a data processor which issues commands to the PTO to adjust the damping force to an optimal value; and
2) "Causal" control which utilizes local sensors on the wave energy converter itself to transmit information to a data processor which then issues appropriate commands to the PTO.

The two advanced control policies developed by Scruggs and Re Vision were then compared to a simple control policy, Coulomb damping, which was utilized by RME during the two rounds of ocean trials it had conducted prior to the commencement of this project.

The project work plan initially included a provision for RME to conduct hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing of the data processors and configurations of valves, sensors and rectifiers needed to implement the two advanced control systems developed by Scruggs and Re Vision Consulting but the funding for that aspect of the project was cut at the conclusion of Budget Period 1. Accordingly, more work needs to be done to determine: a) means and feasibility of implementing real-time control; and b) added costs associated with such implementation taking into account estimated effects on system availability in addition to component costs.

 - Dataset: Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center, OR - Final Technical Report & Appendices: In 2008, the US Department of Energy (DOE) Wind and Water Power Program issued a funding opportunity announcement to establish university-led National Marine Renewable Energy Centers. Oregon State University and the University of Washington combined their capabilities in wave and tidal energy to establish the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center, or NNMREC. NNMREC's scope included research and testing in the following topic areas: 

	- Advanced Wave Forecasting Technologies;
	- Device and Array Optimization;
	- Integrated and Standardized Test Facility Development;
	- Investigate the Compatibility of Marine Energy Technologies with Environment, Fisheries and other Marine Resources;
	- Increased Reliability and Survivability of Marine Energy Systems;
        - Collaboration/Optimization with Marine Renewable and Other Renewable Energy Resources.

To support the last topic, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was brought onto the team, particularly to assist with testing protocols, grid integration, and testing instrumentation.

NNMREC's mission is to facilitate the development of marine energy technology, to inform regulatory and policy decisions, and to close key gaps in scientific understanding with a focus on workforce development. In this, NNMREC achieves DOE's goals and objectives and remains aligned with the research and educational mission of universities. 

In 2012, DOE provided NNMREC an opportunity to propose an additional effort to begin work on a utility scale, grid connected wave energy test facility. That project, initially referred to as the Pacific Marine Energy Center, is now referred to as the Pacific Marine Energy Center South Energy Test Site (PMEC-SETS) and involves work directly toward establishing the facility, which will be in Newport Oregon, as well as supporting instrumentation for wave energy converter testing.

The lab-scaled DOE RM1 is a re-design geometry, based of the full scale DOE RM1 design, producing same power output as the full scale model, while operating at matched Tip Speed Ratio values at reachable laboratory Reynolds number (see attached paper).

In this case study taking advantage of the symmetry of lab-scaled DOE RM1 geometry, only half of the geometry is models using (Single) Rotating Reference Frame model [RRF]. In this model RANS equations, coupled with k-\omega turbulence closure model, are solved in the rotating reference frame. The actual geometry of the turbine blade is included and the turbulent boundary layer along the blade span is simulated using wall-function approach. The rotation of the blade is modeled by applying periodic boundary condition to sets of plane of symmetry.

This case study simulates the performance and flow field in the near and far wake of the device at the desired operating conditions. The results of these simulations were validated against in-house experimental data. Please see the attached paper.

 - Dataset: Updated Overpressures and Permeability Values for PNNL's StimuFrac Fluid: A corrigendum was submitted to the journal of Geothermics on our article "Environmentally friendly, rheoreversible, hydraulic-fracturing fluids for enhanced geothermal systems" Shao et al Geothermics 58 (2015) 22-31.

In the original article some permeability values were underestimated, in particular, for rock samples fractured by the stimuli-responsive fracking fluid (PAA-CO2). In addition, effective pressures were determined to be lower for three control experiments (deionized water-carbon dioxide, DIW-CO2). Therefore, we revised values of permeability and effective pressure as well as performed additional lab-scale stimulation experiments under identical conditions to further verify/update the deductions presented in the discussion section. This is the reason for the additional data introduced in the below Table 1 (grey color).

The authors regret the following inadvertent errors and corresponding modifications. These modifications do not change the scientific conclusions of the article.

 - Dataset: Global Value Chain and Manufacturing Analysis on Geothermal Power Plant Turbines: In this study, we have undertaken a robust analysis of the global supply chain and manufacturing costs for components of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) Turboexpander and steam turbines used in geothermal power plants. We collected a range of market data influencing manufacturing from various data sources and determined the main international manufacturers in the industry. The data includes the manufacturing cost model to identify requirements for equipment, facilities, raw materials, and labor. We analyzed three different cases;
1) 1 MW geothermal ORC Turboexpander 
2) 5 MW ORC Turboexpander
3) 20 MW geothermal Steam Turbine

 - Dataset: Technical Report-Rare Earth Element Data Associated with Oil and Gas Reservoir Rock: This work was developed to complement the geochemical assessments of produced water and geothermal water samples. Specifically, this task was designed to test the influence of reservoir rock-type and corresponding mineralogy/geochemistry on the concentrations of REE found in oil and gas produced waters. There has been no direct investigation of REE reactions relative to rock-type in deep oil and gas brine prior to this investigation.
 - Dataset: S-Layer Nanosheet Binding of Zn and Gd: This data characterizes binding of Zn2+ and Gd3+ to engineered nanosheets at 40C and in a brine solution. The engineered nanosheets are composed of surface-layer (S-layer) proteins which form 2 D crystalline sheets and display Zn2+- or Gd3+-binding domains on these sheets. Their ability to bind Zn2+ is compared to S-layer nanosheets that do not contain Zn2+-binding domains. We found that the purification method of these nanosheets was a critical determinant of their function and thus have provided data on the binding from two different purification methods.

A key distinction of this dataset from other datasets is that the engineered nanosheets were expressed and purified from E. coli grown at 37C as described in (Kinns, 2010; Howorka, 2000),

 - Dataset: Utility Outage Information: Data about power company service areas and their announcements about outages are critical for the effective coordination of resources after disasters, and also for building community and neighborhood resilience.  As part of the 2015 White House Mapathon, the Department of Energy's [Office of Electricity] (https://www.energy.gov/oe/office-electricity) created a national geospatial database of power company service areas with pointers to public outage information (eg, through Twitter, web sites, and toll-free telephone numbers).

Mapathon participants researched public outage information state by state, and populated a lookup table so that disaster-impacted residents, tourists, first responders and relief volunteers can easily get to the information they need on scope and estimated restore times for power outages. This project benefited from participation of private and public sector folks who need this data for their work, and of third party app developers such as Red Cross and The Weather Channel who will incorporate this data into the information services they offer their users.
 - Dataset: Active Source 3D Seismic Tomography of Brady Hot Springs Geothermal Field, Nevada: We deployed a dense seismic array to image the shallow structure in the injection area of the Brady Hot Springs geothermal site in Nevada. The array was composed of 238 5 Hz, three-component nodal instruments and 8,700 m of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fiber-optic cable installed in surface trenches plus 400 m installed in a borehole. The geophone array had about 60 m instrument spacing in the target zone, whereas DAS channel separations were about 1 m. The acquisition systems provided 15 days of continuous records including active source and ambient noise signals. A large vibroseis truck (T-Rex) was operated at 196 locations exciting a swept-frequency signal from 5 to 80 Hz over 20 seconds using three vibration modes. Sweeps were repeated up to four times during different modes of geothermal plant operation: normal operation, shutdown, high and oscillatory injection and production, and normal operation again. The cross- correlation method was utilized to remove the sweep signal from the geophone records. The first P arrivals were automatically picked from the cross-correlation functions using a combination of methods, and the travel times were used to invert for the 3D P-wave velocity structure.

Models with 50 m horizontal node spacing were obtained, with vertical node spacing of 10 to 50 m. The travel time data were fit to about 30 ms, close to our estimated picking uncertainty. Boundaries between high and low velocity zones agree with previous surveys of local faults and low velocity zones near the surface correspond to fumarole locations. A rapid increase in velocity at about 50 m depth fits with borehole data on the depth of the Quaternary sediments. There is some evidence for changes in the P-wave velocity during the experiment with slower travel times at the beginning of the experiment.

The Better Building’s Clean Energy for Low Income Communities Accelerator (CELICA) was launched in 2016 to help state and local partners across the nation meet their goals for increasing uptake of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies in low and moderate income communities. As a part of the Accelerator, DOE created this Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool to assist partners with understanding their LMI community characteristics. This can be utilized for low income and moderate income energy policy and program planning, as it provides interactive state, county and city level worksheets with graphs and data including number of households at different income levels and numbers of homeowners versus renters. It provides a breakdown based on fuel type, building type, and construction year. It also provides average monthly energy expenditures and energy burden (percentage of income spent on energy). 

HOW TO USE:

The LEAD tool can be used to support program design and goal setting, and they can be paired with other data to improve LMI community energy benchmarking and program evaluation. Datasets are available for all 50 states, census divisions, and tract levels. You will have to enable macros in MS Excel to interact with the data. A description of each of the files and what states are included in each U.S. Census Division can be found in the file "DESCRIPTION OF FILES".

 - Dataset: Geothermal Exploration Cost and Time: This paper describes the methodology used to define the baseline exploration suite of techniques (baseline), as well as the approach that was used to create the cost and time data set that populates the baseline. The resulting product, an online tool for measuring impact, and the aggregated cost and time data are available on the Open Energy Information website (OpenEI, http://en.openei.org) for public access.  The Department of Energy's Geothermal Technology Office (GTO) provides RD&D funding for geothermal exploration technologies with the goal of lowering the risks and costs of geothermal development and exploration. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) developed this cost and time metric included collecting cost and time data for exploration techniques, creating a baseline suite of exploration techniques to which future exploration cost and time improvements can be compared, and developing an online tool for graphically showing potential project impacts (all available at http://en.openei.org/wiki/Gateway: Geothermal).

 - Dataset: Advanced WEC Dynamics and Controls, Test 1: Numerous studies have shown that advanced control of a wave energy converter's (WEC's) power take off (PTO) can provide significant increases (on the order of 200-300%) in WEC energy absorption. Transitioning these control approaches from simplified paper studies to application in full-scale devices remains an open and extremely challenging problem will be central to creating economically competitive WECs and delivering clean renewable energy to the US electrical grid. The Advanced WEC Dynamics and Controls project is targeted on assisting WEC developers to apply novel control systems for their devices and thus achieving major increases in performance and economic viability. The success of any control strategy is based directly upon the availability of a reduced-order model with the ability to accurately capture the dynamics of the system with sufficient accuracy. A model-scale WEC was designed and fabricated for use in studies to advance the state-of-the-art in WEC controls. This test, which is the first in a series of planned tests, focused on system identification (system ID) and model validation.
 - Dataset: Pacific Marine Energy Center benthic physical conditions, macrofauna, and groundfish abundances: From 2010 to 2015, box core grabs were collected at permanent stations around the Pacific Marine Energy Center - North Energy Test Site (PMEC-NETS) off Newport, Oregon. At each box core station a conductivity, temperature, depth (CTD) cast was conducted. These data include the CTD from the bottom of the cast, sediment grain size analysis, total organic carbon and nitrogen analysis (for the first 3 years only) and macrofaunal organism abundances as retained on a 1 mm mesh sieve.

 - Dataset: Admiralty Inlet Advanced Turbulence Measurements: May 2015: This data is from measurements at Admiralty Head, in Admiralty Inlet (Puget Sound) in May of 2015. The measurements were made using Inertial Motion Unit (IMU) equipped ADVs mounted on a 'StableMoor' (Manufacturer: DeepWater Buoyancy) buoy and a Tidal Turbulence Mooring (TTM). These platforms position ADV heads above the seafloor to make mid-depth turbulence measurements. The inertial measurements from the IMU allows for removal of mooring motion in post processing.

The mooring and buoy motion has been removed from the stream-wise and vertical velocity signals (u, w). The lateral (v) velocity has some 'persistent motion contamination' due to mooring sway.

The TTM was deployed with one ADV, it's position was: 48 09.145', -122 41.209'

The StableMoor was deployed twice, the first time it was deployed in 'wing-mode' with two ADVs ('Port' and 'Star') at: 48 09.166', -122 41.173'

The second StableMoor deployment was in 'Nose' mode with one ADV at: 48 09.166', -122 41.174'

 - Dataset: Simulations of Brady's-Type Fault Undergoing CO2 Push-Pull: Pressure-Transient and Sensitivity Analysis: Input and output files used for fault characterization through numerical simulation using iTOUGH2. The synthetic data for the push period are generated by running a forward simulation (input parameters are provided in iTOUGH2 Brady GF6 Input Parameters.txt [InvExt6i.txt]). In general, the permeability of the fault gouge, damage zone, and matrix are assumed to be unknown. The input and output files are for the inversion scenario where only pressure transients are available at the monitoring well located 200 m above the injection well and only the fault gouge permeability is estimated. The input files are named InvExt6i, INPUT.tpl, FOFT.ins, CO2TAB, and the output files are InvExt6i.out, pest.fof, and pest.sav (names below are display names).  

The table graphic in the data files below summarizes the inversion results, and indicates the fault gouge permeability can be estimated even if imperfect guesses are used for matrix and damage zone permeabilities, and permeability anisotropy is not taken into account.

 - Dataset: Effective Elastic and Neutron Capture Cross Section Calculations Corresponding to Simulated Fluid Properties from CO2 Push-Pull Simulations: The submission contains a .xls files consisting of 10 excel sheets, which contain combined list of pressure, saturation, salinity, temperature profiles from the simulation of CO2 push-pull using Brady reservoir model and the corresponding effective compressional and shear velocity, bulk density, and fluid and time-lapse neutron capture cross section profiles of rock at times 0 day (baseline) through 14 days.
First 9 sheets (each named after the corresponding CO2 push-pull simulation time) contains simulated pressure, saturation, temperature, salinity profiles and the corresponding effective elastic and neutron capture cross section profiles of rock matrix at the time of CO2 injection. Each sheet contains two sets of effective compressional velocity profiles of the rock, one based on Gassmann and the other based on Patchy saturation model. Effective neutron capture cross section calculations are done using a proprietary neutron cross-section simulator (SNUPAR) whereas for the thermodynamic properties of CO2 and bulk density of rock matrix filled with fluid, a standalone fluid substitution tool by Schlumberger is used.
Last sheet in the file contains the bulk modulus of solid rock, which is inverted from the rock properties (porosity, sound speed etc) based on Gassmann model. Bulk modulus of solid rock in turn is used in the fluid substitution.

 - Dataset: TEM and Gravity Data for Roosevelt Hot Springs, Utah FORGE Site: This submission includes a gravity data in text format and as a GIS point shapefile and transient electromagnetic (TEM) raw data. Each text file additionally contains location data (UTM Zone 12, NAD83) and elevation (meters) data for that station.

The gravity data shapefile was in part downloaded from PACES, University of Texas at El Paso, http://gis.utep.edu/subpages/GMData.html, and in part collected by the Utah Geological Survey (UGS) as part of the DOE GTO supported Utah FORGE geothermal energy project near Milford, Utah. The PACES data were examined and scrubbed to eliminate any questionable data. A 2.67 g/cm^3 reduction density was used for the Bouguer correction.

The attribute table column headers for the gravity data shapefile are explained below. There is also metadata attached to the GIS shapefile.

name: the individual gravity station name.
HAE: height above ellipsoid [meter]
NGVD29: vertical datum for geoid [meter]
obs: observed gravity
ERRG: gravity measurement error [mGal]
IZTC: inner zone terrain correction [mGal]
OZTC: outer zone terrain correction [mGal]
Gfa: free air gravity

 - Dataset: GIS Well Temperature Data from the Roosevelt Hot Springs, Utah FORGE Site: This is a GIS point feature shapefile representing wells, and their temperatures, that are located in the general Utah FORGE area near Milford, Utah. There are also fields that represent interpolated temperature values at depths of 200 m, 1000 m, 2000 m, 3000 m, and 4000 m. in degrees Fahrenheit.

The temperature values at specific depths as mentioned above were derived as follows. In cases where the well reached a given depth (200 m and 1, 2, 3, or 4 km), the temperature is the measured temperature.  For the shallower wells (and at deeper depths in the wells reaching one or more of the target depths), temperatures were extrapolated from the temperature-depth profiles that appeared to have stable (re-equilibrated after drilling) and linear profiles within the conductive regime (i.e. below the water table or other convective influences such as shallow hydrothermal outflow from the Roosevelt Hydrothermal System). Measured temperatures/gradients from deeper wells (when available and reasonably close to a given well) were used to help constrain the extrapolation to greater depths.  

Most of the field names in the attribute table are intuitive, however HF = heat flow, intercept = the temperature at the surface (x-axis of the temperature-depth plots) based on the linear segment of the plot that was used to extrapolate the temperature profiles to greater depths, and depth_m is the total well depth. This information is also present in the shapefile metadata.

 - Dataset: Newberry EGS Literature References: Research references to literature about the Newberry geothermal area, Oregon.
 - Dataset: A Thermal-Hydrological-Chemical Model for the EGS Demonstration Project at Newberry Volcano, OR: Newberry Volcano in Central Oregon is the site of a Department of Energy funded Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) Demonstration Project. Stimulation and production of an EGS is a strong perturbation to the physical and chemical environment, giving rise to coupled Thermal-Hydrological-Mechanical-Chemical (THMC) processes leading to permeability changes as a result of mineral dissolution and precipitation, rock deformation, and fracture reactivation. To evaluate these processes, and to help guide EGS stimulation and reservoir development strategies, a combined native-state and reservoir model of the west flank of Newberry Volcano was created that encompasses the planned stimulation zone and a several km region of the west flank from the surface down to the supercritical region, likely close to a postulated cooling intrusive body. Temperature and pressure distributions were first modeled using TOUGHREACT with boundary conditions estimated from nearby drill holes, and compared to measurements made in the over 3 km deep NWG 55-29 drill hole. With estimates of the porosity and heat capacities for the major hydrogeologic units, thermal conductivities were calibrated by matching to the measured temperature profile. To simulate the development of the observed hydrothermal mineralogy, a reaction-transport model (THC) was developed using the pre-alteration mineralogy and shallow groundwater chemistry as the initial geochemical conditions, assuming that modeled temperature and pressure distributions were relatively constant over several thousand years. Close correspondence of modeled and observed epidote distributions support the observation that past hydrothermal activity took place under thermal gradients similar to current values, whereas calcite and sulfide abundances at depth likely require a magmatic gas component. Multicomponent geothermometry was used to estimate potential temperatures of equilibration of waters, and to evaluate the effects of kinetics on calculated mineral equilibration temperatures. The ultimate goal will be to capture both the local chemical and mechanical changes in the rock owing to stimulation as well as the potential long-term response and sustainability of the larger-scale geothermal reservoir.

 - Dataset: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) Data for Periodic Hydraulic Tests: Hydraulic Data: Hydraulic responses from periodic hydraulic tests conducted at the Mirror Lake Fractured Rock Research Site, during the summer of 2015.  These hydraulic responses were measured also using distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) which is cataloged in a different submission under this grant number.   The tests are explained in detail in Matthew Cole's MS Thesis which is cataloged here. 

The injection and drawdown data and the codes used to analyze the data. Sinusoidal Data is a Matlab data file containing a data table for each period-length test. Within each table is a column labeled: time (seconds since beginning of pumping), Inj_m3pm (formation injection in cubic meters per minute), and head for each observation well (meters). The three Matlab script files (*.m) were used to analyze hydraulic responses from the data file above. High-Pass Sinusoid is a routine for filtering the data, computing the FFT, and extracting phase and amplitude values. Borestore is a routine which contains the borehole storage analytic solution and compares modeled amplitude and phase from this solution to computed amplitude and phase from the data. Patsearch Borestore is a routine containing the built-in pattern search optimization method. This minimizes the total error between modeled and actual amplitude and phase in Borestore. Comments within the script files contain more specific instructions for their use.
 - Dataset: Nevada Great Basin Play Fairway Analysis - Reports & Appendices: This project focused on defining geothermal play fairways and development of a detailed geothermal potential map of a large transect across the Great Basin region (96,000 km2), with the primary objective of facilitating discovery of commercial-grade, blind geothermal fields (i.e. systems with no surface hot springs or fumaroles) and thereby accelerating geothermal development in this promising region. Data included in this submission consists of: structural settings (target areas, recency of faulting, slip and dilation potential, slip rates, quality), regional-scale strain rates, earthquake density and magnitude, gravity data, temperature at 3 km depth, permeability models, favorability models, degree of exploration and exploration opportunities, data from springs and wells, transmission lines and wilderness areas, and published maps and theses for the Nevada Play Fairway area. 
 - Dataset: Techno-Economic Assessment for Integrating Biosorption into Rare Earth Recovery Process: The current uncertainty in the global supply of rare earth elements (REEs) necessitates the development of novel extraction technologies that utilize a variety of REE source materials. Herein, we examined the techno-economic performance of integrating a biosorption approach into a large-scale process for producing salable total rare earth oxides (TREOs) from various feedstocks. An airlift bioreactor is proposed to carry out a biosorption process mediated by bioengineered rare earth-adsorbing bacteria. Techno-economic assessments were compared for three distinctive categories of REE feedstocks requiring different pre-processing steps. Key parameters identified that affect profitability include REE concentration, composition of the feedstock, and costs of feedstock pretreatment and waste management. Among the 11 specific feedstocks investigated, coal ash from the Appalachian Basin was projected to be the most profitable, largely due to its high-value REE content. Its cost breakdown includes pre-processing (leaching primarily, 77.1%), biosorption (19.4%), and oxalic acid precipitation and TREO roasting (3.5%). Surprisingly, biosorption from the high-grade Bull Hill REE ore is less profitable due to high material cost and low production revenue. Overall, our results confirmed that the application of biosorption to low-grade feedstocks for REE recovery is economically viable.
 - Dataset: Washington Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis Technical Report: An investment of $0.7M from the Geothermal Technology Office for Phase 2 of Play Fairway Analysis in Washington State improved existing favorability models and increased model confidence. New 1:24,000-scale geological mapping, 15 detailed geophysical surveys, 2 passive seismic surveys, and geochronology collected during this phase were coupled with updated and detailed structural modeling and have significantly improved the conceptual models of three potential blind geothermal systems/plays in Washington State, the St. Helens Shear Zone, Mount Baker, and Wind River Valley. Results of this analysis reveal the presence of commercially viable undiscovered geothermal resources in all three study areas. The analysis additionally provides a clear definition of the geothermal prospects in terms of the essential elements of a functioning geothermal system, the confidence in these assessments, and associated potential and risk of development. 

This report also includes a proposal to validate the modeling results in highly favorable areas for two main reasons: (1) to develop confidence in the modeling approach that will encourage future development of geothermal resources in Washington State inside and outside of the Phase 2 study areas, and (2) to provide actionable results to the DOE, existing industry partners, newly identified developers, and other renewable-energy stakeholders. The proposed validation activities aim to collect new data that will further the understanding of geothermal resource potential in Washington, as well as substantiate the favorability, confidence, and risk models developed in Phases 1 and 2. 
 - Dataset: Washington Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis Data From Potential Field Studies: A recent study which adapts play fairway analysis (PFA) methodology to assess geothermal potential was conducted at three locations (Mount Baker, Mount St. Helens seismic zone, and Wind River valley) along the Washington Cascade Range (Forson et al. 2017). Potential field (gravity and magnetic) methods which can detect subsurface contrasts in physical properties, provides a means for mapping and modeling subsurface geology and structure.  As part of the WA-Cascade PFA project, we performed potential field studies by collecting high-resolution gravity and ground-magnetic data, and rock property measurements to (1) identify and constrain fault geometries (2) constrain subsurface lithologic distribution (3) study fault interactions (4) identify areas favorable to hydrothermal flow, and ultimately (5) guide future geothermal exploration at each location.

Data are provided for 3 major geothermal models: heat, permeability, and fluid-filled fractures, and an additional infrastructure model. Both of the permeability and fluid-filled-fracture models are produced at 200 m and at 2 km depths; the heat model is only produced at the 200 m depth. Values are provided for both model favorability and model confidence. A combined model at 200m and 2 km depths is provided for favorability, confidence, and exploration risk.

Raster data are provided in GeoTiff format and have a statewide coverage. Cell size is 104.355 ft; file type is unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255); 0 represents no favorability or confidence; 255 represents maximum favorability or confidence. The NAD83(HARN)/Washington South (ftUS) projection is used (EPSG:2927). Vector data are provided in shapefile or comma-delimited text file formats. Geographic coordinates, where provided, are in WGS84. A readme file accompanies each folder and provides an overview and description of the enclosed data.

The heat model combines 5 intermediate raster layers (which are included in the download package): temperature gradient wells, young volcanic vents, hot springs, young intrusive volcanic rocks, and geothermometry. The permeability model combines 8 intermediate raster layers: density of mapped faults, 2D dilation tendency of mapped faults, 2D slip tendency of mapped faults, seismicity, 3D dilation tendency, 3D slip tendency, 3D maximum coulomb shear stress, and 3D slip gradients. The fluid-filled fracture model combines up to 4 intermediate rasters: resistivity from magneto-telluric 3D inversions, seismicity, Vp/Vs anomalies from passive seismic tomography, and Vs anomalies from ambient-noise tomography.

A statewide infrastructure model is also provided that formalizes land-use constraints and restrictions relevant for geothermal prospecting and development. This model combines 10 intermediate rasters: areas off limits to drilling, existing or proposed geothermal leases, DNR-owned land, land-use restrictions along the Columbia River Gorge, areas inundated by water, availability of potential process water, proximity to existing roads, proximity to transmission lines, distance from urban areas, and snow-related elevation restrictions.

Supporting vector data for the development of each raster layer is provided.

Herein, we examined the techno-economic performance of integrating a biosorption approach into a large-scale process for producing salable total rare earth oxides (TREOs) from various feedstocks.  An airlift bioractor is proposed to carry out a biosorption process mediated by bioengineered rare earth-adsorbing bacteria.  Techno-econmic asssements were compared for three distinctive categories of REE feedstocks requiring different pre-processing steps. Key parameters identified that affect profitability include REE concentration, composition of the feedstock, and costs of feedstock pretreatment and waste management.  Among the 11 specific feedstocks investigated, coal ash from the Appalachian Basin was projected to be the most profitable, largely due to its high-value REE content.  Its cost breakdown includes pre-processing (primarily leaching) (8077.71%), biosorption (1619.04%), and oxalic acid precipitation and TREO roasting (3.35%). Surprisingly, biosorption from the high-grade Bull Hill REE ore is less profitable due to high material cost and low production revenue. Overall, our results confirmed that the application of biosorption to low-grade feedstocks for REE recovery is economically viable. 
 - Dataset: Design of an Airlift Bioreactor: An important consideration for the process design is cell immobilization-enabled flow-through operation. Large-scale biosorption relies on cells that are immobilized on a supporting substrate and used to 'attract' metal ions.  Cell immobilization allows easy separation of the feed solution and REEs that are attached to the cell surface. It also allows continuous operation without the need of energy-intensive centrifugation or filtration. Lightweight, high surface area, low cost (~$200/m3) high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic disks are used as cell carriers for biofilm formation.
 - Dataset: Great Salt Lake Composition and Rare Earth Speciation Analysis: We have conducted aqueous speciation analyses of the Great Salt Lake (GSL) brine sample (Table 1) and a mock geo sample (Table 2) spiked with 1 ppb Tb and 100 ppb Tb. The GSL speciation (Figure 1) aligns with our basic speciation expectations that strong carbonate complexes would form at mid to higher pH's. Although we expected strong aqueous complexes with fluorides at neutral pH and with chlorides, and hydroxides at low pH, we observe that the dominant species in the low to mid pH range to be Tb3+ as a free ion. Still, we do see the presence of fluoride and chloride complexes within the expected low to mid pH range. 
 - Dataset: Rare Earth Element Biomining from the Great Salt Lake Brine Using Engineered E.

Our results showed that Tb binds to LBT, even in the presence of high concentrations of competing metals.  We also tested REE adsorption at elevated temperatures (up to 100 degrees Celsius), and observed that Tb adsorption increases with temperature of to 70 degrees Celsius, and then remains constant until 100 degrees Celsius.  Data analyses were performed using an ICP-MS at UCSC.

Although there are large variations, the average temperature gradient exceeds 80 deg C/km. Recently, high-resolution gravity, ground magnetic, magnetotelluric (MT), and seismic reflection surveys have been carried out in the area in order to define key structural features responsible for promoting permeability and fluid flow. Of particular relevance is the MT survey performed in the Mountain Home area. 

The included reports and papers present preliminary and final 3-D numerical models of the natural-state (i.e. pre-production state) of the Mountain Home geothermal area conditioned using the available temperature profiles from the five deep wells in addition to interpretations of MT data.

 - Dataset: Water Use in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS): Geology of U.S. Stimulation Projects, Water Costs, and Alternative Water Use Policies: According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), geothermal energy generation in the United States is projected to more than triple by 2040 (EIA 2013). This addition, which translates to more than 5 GW of generation capacity, is anticipated because of technological advances and an increase in available sources through the continued development of enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) and low-temperature resources (EIA 2013). Studies have shown that air emissions, water consumption, and land use for geothermal electricity generation have less of an impact than traditional fossil fuel-based electricity generation; however, the long-term sustainability of geothermal power plants can be affected by insufficient replacement of aboveground or belowground operational fluid losses resulting from normal operations (Schroeder et al. 2014). Thus, access to water is therefore critical for increased deployment of EGS technologies and, therefore, growth of the geothermal sector. This paper examines water issues relating to EGS development from a variety of perspectives. It starts by exploring the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.  It then examines the relative costs of different potential traditional and alternative water sources for EGS. Finally it summarizes specific state policies relevant to the use of alternative water sources for EGS, and finally explores the relationship between EGS site geology, stimulation protocols, and below ground water loss, which is one of the largest drivers of water consumption for EGS projects.

 - Dataset: Geologic and Geophysical Data for Wells Drilled at Raft River Valley, Cassia County, Idaho, in 1977 to 1978 and Data for Wells Drilled Previously: In order to better define the size of the thermal anomaly in the Raft River Valley, Idaho, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a series of intermediate-depth (nominal 500-ft depth) wells in 1977 and 1978. This report presents geologic, geophysical, and temperature data for these drill holes, along with data for five wells drilled by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory with U.S. Department of Energy funding. Data previously reported for other drill holes are also included in order to make them available as digital files.
 - Dataset: Operational Performance Requirements For Motor Power Sections Used in Geothermal Drilling Based Upon Minimum Specific Energy: Operational performance requirements are needed to support development of specifications for downhole motor power sections to be used for drilling hard rock during geothermal wellbore construction.  Theoretical torque specifications are derived based upon a widely-accepted rock-reduction model in the literature using representative properties for typical rock formations.  The derived values correspond to optimum motor performance for rock reduction at minimum specific energy and form a set of minimum requirements on output torque and power for downhole motors.  Actual values should be increased to account for factors such as increased hydrostatic pressure at depth, bit wear, heterogeneous rock, and non-ideal drilling conditions.
 - Dataset: Practices Maintain Straight Hole in Crooked Hole Conditions, While Also Enabling Significant Gains in Drill Rate: Bottom hole assembly (BHA) designs were assessed in field trials for their ability to achieve critical low inclination requirements, while simultaneously enabling high drill rates.  Because angle has historically been controlled by reducing weight on bit (WOB), these are often competing priorities.  The use of real time surveillance of mechanical specific energy (MSE) provided unique insights into the bit dysfunction that occurs with many practices used to control angle. These quantitative insights supported the development of BHA and operating practices that maintained low angle while also achieving major gains in drilling performance.   

The McGinness Hills field in Lander County Nevada is a geothermal operation with wells drilled in hard metamorphic and crystalline formations.  Wellbore inclinations must be maintained below 2.0 degrees in the critical 20 inch interval in order to allow use of lineshaft pumps, which is challenging in the required hole sizes and rock hardness.  Formation strengths are similar to petroleum operations in the Rockies and West Texas.  

Pendulum and packed-hole assemblies were tested, and straight motors and slick assemblies were used for corrections.  Well build rates were assumed to be controlled by the three-point curvature in the lower assembly and stabilizer placement was modified to control this curvature.  The effectiveness of the curvature control as WOB was increased was evaluated from inclination measurements.  Real time MSE analysis was used to manage bit operating performance and to determine the root causes of bit dysfunction.

The results demonstrated that packed-hole assemblies could be designed that controlled inclination while enabling 2-3 times higher WOB, and that the use of pendulum assemblies should be eliminated.  Packed assemblies drilled 87% faster.  The increased WOB resulted in higher drill rates, major reduction in whirl and extended bit life, which are equally important performance objectives in hard rock drilling.  The use of MSE surveillance allowed the physical processes to be understood deterministically, so that the philosophical design principles can be applied in other petroleum and geothermal operations.

 - Dataset: Development of a Downhole Tool Measuring Real-Time Concentration of Ionic Tracers and pH in Geothermal Reservoirs: For enhanced or Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) geothermal brine is pumped to the surface via the production wells, the heat extracted to turn a turbine to generate electricity, and the spent brine re-injected via injection wells back underground. If designed properly, the subsurface rock formations will lead this water back to the extraction well as heated brine. Proper monitoring of these geothermal reservoirs is essential for developing and maintaining the necessary level of productivity of the field. Chemical tracers are commonly used to characterize the fracture network and determine the connectivity between the injection and production wells. Currently, most tracer experiments involve injecting the tracer at the injection well, manually collecting liquid samples at the wellhead of the production well, and sending the samples off for laboratory analysis. While this method provides accurate tracer concentration data at very low levels of detection, it does not provide information regarding the location of the fractures which were conducting the tracer between wellbores. Sandia is developing a high-temperature electrochemical sensor capable of measuring tracer concentrations and pH downhole on a wireline tool. The goal of this effort is to collect real-time pH and ionic tracer concentration data at temperatures up to 225 degrees C and pressures up to 3000 psi. 

In this paper, a prototype electrochemical sensor and the initial data obtained will be presented detailing the measurement of iodide tracer concentrations at high temperature and pressure in a newly developed laboratory scale autoclave.

In this work we present rare earth element (REE) and trace metal behavior in produced water from four Wyoming oil and gas fields and surface ash pond water from two coal-fired power stations. Using the methods of the INL team members, we measured REEs in high salinity oil and gas produced waters. Our results show that REEs exist as a dissolved species in all waters measured for this project, typically within the parts per trillion range.
 - Dataset: Characterizing favourable structural settings of geothermal reservoirs in extensional regions: Enhanced exploration strategies: Exploration of geothermal systems is commonly hampered by the risk of unsuccessful drilling.  A major problem in selecting well sites is that the favorable settings of known systems are generally not adequately characterized.

 - Dataset: 3D Model of the San Emidio Geothermal Area: The San Emidio geothermal system is characterized by a left-step in a west-dipping normal fault system that bounds the western side of the Lake Range.

Overlying Jurrassic-Triassic metasedimentary basement is a ~500 m-1000 m thick section of the Miocene lower Pyramid sequence, pre- syn-extensional Quaternary sedimentary rocks and post-extensional Quaternary rocks. 15-30 degrees eastward dip of the stratigraphy is controlled by the predominant west-dipping fault set. Both geothermal production and injection are concentrated north of the step over in an area of closely spaced west dipping normal faults.
 - Dataset: Topographic and Air-Photo Lineaments in Various Locations Related to Geothermal Exploration in Colorado: These line shapefiles trace apparent topographic and air-photo lineaments in various counties in Colorado. It was made in order to identify possible fault and fracture systems that might be conduits for geothermal fluids, as part of a DOE reconnaissance geothermal exploration program.

Geothermal fluids commonly utilize fault and fractures in competent rocks as conduits for fluid flow. Geothermal exploration involves finding areas of high near-surface temperature gradients, along with a suitable "plumbing system" that can provide the necessary permeability. Geothermal power plants can sometimes be built where temperature and flow rates are high.

This line shapefile is an attempt to use desktop GIS to delineate possible faults and fracture orientations and locations in highly prospective areas prior to an initial site visit. Geochemical sampling and geologic mapping could then be centered around these possible faults and fractures.

To do this, georeferenced topographic maps and aerial photographs were utilized in an existing GIS, using ESRI ArcMap 10.0 software. The USA_Topo_Maps and World_Imagery  map layers were chosen from the GIS Server at  server.arcgisonline.com, using a UTM Zone 13 NAD27 projection. This line shapefile was then constructed over that which appeared to be through-going structural lineaments in both the aerial photographs and topographic layers, taking care to avoid manmade features such as roads, fence lines, and utility right-of-ways.  Still, it is unknown what actual features these lineaments, if they exist, represent.

Although the shapefiles are arranged by county, not all areas within any county have been examined for lineaments. Work was focused on either satellite thermal infrared anomalies, known hot springs or wells, or other evidence of geothermal systems. Finally, lineaments may be displaced somewhat from their actual location, due to such factors as shadow effects with low sun angles in the aerial photographs.

Credits:
These lineament shapefile was created by Geothermal Development Associates, as part of a geothermal geologic reconnaissance performed by Flint Geothermal, LLC, of Denver Colorado.

Use Limitation:
These shapefiles were constructed as an aid to geothermal exploration in preparation for a site visit for field checking. We make no claims as to the existence of the lineaments, their location, orientation, and/or nature.

 - Dataset: Advanced Geothermal Drilling and Logging Technologies: The objective of advanced drilling and logging technologies is to promote ways and means to reduce the cost of geothermal drilling through an integrated effort which involves developing an understanding of geothermal drilling and logging needs, elucidating best practices, and fostering an environment and mechanisms to share methods and means to advance the state of the art. Drilling is an essential and expensive part of geothermal exploration, development, and utilization. Drilling, logging, and completing geothermal wells are expensive because of high temperatures and hard, fractured formations. The consequences of reducing cost are often impressive, because drilling and well completion can account for more than half of the capital cost for a geothermal power project.

The objectives of Advanced Geothermal Drilling and Logging Technologies are:
1. Quantitatively understand geothermal drilling costs from around the world and identify ways to reduce those costs, while maintaining or enhancing productivity.
2. Identify and develop new and improved technologies for significantly reducing the cost of geothermal well construction to lower the cost of electricity and/or heat produced with geothermal resources.
3. Inform the international geothermal community about these drilling technologies.
4. Provide a vehicle for international cooperation, field tests, etc. toward the development and demonstration of improved geothermal drilling and logging technologies.

 - Dataset: Development of a Downhole Tracer and pH Measurement Instrument for Application in Geothermal Wells: Due the high temperature and pressure conditions found in geothermal wells, tracer studies designed to elucidate properties of geothermal reservoirs are traditionally conducted by pulling liquid samples from the wellhead. These samples are then sent off for analysis in a fixed laboratory setting. Unfortunately by pulling the sample from the surface, information regarding the depth of the fractures generating the tracer flow is lost. Additionally, significant time is lost in sending the samples off for traditional chemical analysis. This presentation focuses on our efforts to develop downhole high temperature and pressure stable ion selective electrodes capable of measuring the concentration of tracers used in geothermal studies, along with pH, at various depths in the wellbore creating tracer concentration and pH depth profiles for use in geothermal reservoir analysis.

 - Dataset: GEO2D - Two-Dimensional Computer Model of a Ground Source Heat Pump System: This file contains a zipped file that contains many files required to run GEO2D. GEO2D is a computer code for simulating ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems in two-dimensions. GEO2D performs a detailed finite difference simulation of the heat transfer occurring within the working fluid, the tube wall, the grout, and the ground. Both horizontal and vertical wells can be simulated with this program, but it should be noted that the vertical wall is modeled as a single tube.  This program also models the heat pump in conjunction with the heat transfer occurring. GEO2D simulates the heat pump and ground loop as a system. Many results are produced by GEO2D as a function of time and position, such as heat transfer rates, temperatures and heat pump performance. On top of this information from an economic comparison between the geothermal system simulated and a comparable air heat pump systems or a comparable gas, oil or propane heating systems with a vapor compression air conditioner. The version of GEO2D in the attached file has been coupled to the DOE heating and cooling load software called ENERGYPLUS. This is a great convenience for the user because heating and cooling loads are an input to GEO2D. GEO2D is a user friendly program that uses a graphical user interface for inputs and outputs. These make entering data simple and they produce many plotted results that are easy to understand.  In order to run GEO2D access to MATLAB is required.

 - Dataset: Active Management of Integrated Geothermal-CO2 Storage Reservoirs in Sedimentary Formations: Active Management of Integrated Geothermal-CO2 Storage Reservoirs in Sedimentary Formations: An Approach to Improve Energy Recovery and Mitigate Risk:  FY1 Final Report
The purpose of phase 1 is to determine the feasibility of integrating geologic CO2 storage (GCS) with geothermal energy production. Phase 1 includes reservoir analyses to determine injector/producer well schemes that balance the generation of economically useful flow rates at the producers with the need to manage reservoir overpressure to reduce the risks associated with overpressure, such as induced seismicity and CO2 leakage to overlying aquifers.

This submission contains input and output files of the reservoir model analyses. A reservoir-model "index-html" file has been included to organize the reservoir-model input and output files according to sections of the FY1 Final Report to which they pertain. The recipient should save the file: Reservoir-models-inputs-outputs-index.html in the same directory that the files: Section2.1.*.tar.gz files are saved in.
 - Dataset: Technology Development and Field Trials of EGS Drilling Systems at Chocolate Mountain: Polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits are routinely used in the oil and gas industry for drilling medium to hard rock but have not been adopted for geothermal drilling, largely due to past reliability issues and higher purchase costs.  The Sandia Geothermal Research Department has recently completed a field demonstration of the applicability of advanced synthetic diamond drill bits for production geothermal drilling.  Two commercially-available PDC bits were tested in a geothermal drilling program in the Chocolate Mountains in Southern California.  These bits drilled the granitic formations with significantly better Rate of Penetration (ROP) and bit life than the roller cone bit they are compared with. Drilling records and bit performance data along with associated drilling cost savings are presented herein.  The drilling trials have demonstrated PDC bit drilling technology has matured for applicability and improvements to geothermal drilling.  This will be especially beneficial for development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems whereby resources can be accessed anywhere within the continental US by drilling to deep, hot resources in hard, basement rock formations.


 - Dataset: Hotspot Project: The Snake River Geothermal Drilling Project Initial Report: The Snake River volcanic province (SRP) overlies a thermal anomaly that extends deep into the mantle; it represents one of the highest heat flow provinces in North America. The primary goal of this project is to evaluate geothermal potential in three distinct settings: (1) Kimama site: inferred high sub-aquifer geothermal gradient associated with the intrusion of mafic magmas, (2) Kimberly site: a valley-margin setting where surface heat flow may be driven by the up-flow of hot fluids along buried caldera ring-fault complexes, and (3) Mountain Home site: a more traditional fault-bounded basin with thick sedimentary cover. In-depth studies continue at all three sites, complemented by high-resolution gravity, magnetic, and seismic surveys, and by downhole geophysical logging.

This 2016 submission includes data pertinent to the methods and results of an analysis of the Surface Levelized Cost of Heat (SLCOH) for US Census Bureau 'Places' within the study area. The SLCOHis was calculated using a modification of a program called GEOPHIRES, available at http://koenraadbeckers.net/geophires/index.php. 

In addition to calculating SLCOH, this task also identified many industrial sites that may be prospects for use of a geothermal district heating system, based on their size and industry, rather than on the SLCOH. An industry sorted listing and maps of the sites have been plotted as a layer onto different iterations of maps combining the three geologic risk factors (Thermal Quality, Natural Reservoir Quality, and Risk of Seismicity). In addition, a shapefile of the industrial sites is also included with 7 associated files. Supporting files are also supplied.

 - Dataset: Lab-Scale Stimulation Results on Surrogate Fused Silica Samples: Lab-scale stimulation work on non-porous fused silica (similar mechanical properties to igneous rock) was performed using pure water, pure CO2 and water/CO2 mixtures to compare back to back fracturing performance of these fluids with PNNL's StimuFrac.
 - Dataset: StimuFrac Compressibility as a Function of CO2 Molar Fraction: Compressibility values were obtained in a range of pressures at 250degC by employing a fixed volume view cell completely filled with PAA aqueous solution and injecting CO2 at constant flow rate (0.3mL/min). Pressure increase as a function of supercritical CO2 (scCO2) mass fraction in the mixture was monitored.
The plot shows the apparent compressibility of Stimufrac as a function of scCO2 mass fraction obtained in a pressure range between 2100-7000 psi at 250degC.

At small mass fractions of scCO2 the compressibility increases probably due to the dissolution/reaction of CO2 in aqueous PAA and reaches a maximum at mCO2/mH2O = 0.06. Then, compressibility decreases showing a linear relationship with scCO2 mass fraction due to the continuous increase in density of the binary fluid associated to the pressure increase.

 - Dataset: West Flank Coso FORGE Magnetotelluric 3D Data: This is the 3D version of the MT data for the West Flank FORGE area.The Coso geothermal field has had three Magnetotelluric (MT) datasets collected including surveys in 2003, 2006, and 2011. The final collection, in 2011, expanded the survey to the west and covers the West Flank of FORGE area.This most recent data set was collected by Schlumberger/WesternGeco and inverted by the WesternGeco GeoSolutions Integrated EM Center of Excellence in Milan, Italy; the 2003 and 2006 data were integrated for these inversions in the present study.
 - Dataset: West Flank Coso, CA FORGE 3D Temperature Model: x,y,z data of the 3D temperature model for the West Flank Coso FORGE site. Model grid spacing is 250m. 

The temperature model for the Coso geothermal field used over 100 geothermal production sized wells and intermediate-depth temperature holes. At the near surface of this model, two boundary temperatures were assumed:  (1) areas with surface manifestations, including fumaroles along the northeast striking normal faults and northwest striking dextral faults with the hydrothermal field, a temperature of ~104 deg C was applied to datum at +1066 meters above sea level elevation, and (2) a near-surface temperature at about 10 meters depth, of 20 deg C was applied below the diurnal and annual conductive temperature perturbations. These assumptions were based on heat flow studies conducted at the CVF and for the Mojave Desert. 
On the edges of the hydrothermal system, a 73 deg C/km temperature gradient contour was established using conductive gradient data from shallow and intermediate-depth temperature holes. This contour was continued to all elevation datums between the 20 deg C surface and -1520 meters below mean sea level. Because the West Flank is outside of the geothermal field footprint, during Phase 1, the three wells inside the FORGE site were incorporated into the preexisting temperature model. 

To ensure a complete model was built based on all the available data sets, measured bottom-hole temperature gradients in certain wells were downward extrapolated to the next deepest elevation datum (or a maximum of about 25% of the well depth where conductive gradients are evident in the lower portions of the wells). After assuring that the margins of the geothermal field were going to be adequately modelled, the data was contoured using the Kriging method algorithm. Although the extrapolated temperatures and boundary conditions are not rigorous, the calculated temperatures are anticipated to be within ~6 deg C (20 deg F), or one contour interval, of the observed data within the Coso geothermal field.  Based on a lack of temperature data west of 74-2TCH, the edges of this model still seem to have an effect on West Flank modeled temperatures.

 - Dataset: Publication: A Conceptual Geologic Model for the Newberry Volcano EGS Site in Central Oregon: Constraining Heat Capacity and Permeability through Interpretation of Multicomponent Geosystems Data: Newberry Volcano, a voluminous (500 km3) basaltic/andesitic/rhyolitic shield volcano located near the intersection of the Cascade volcanic arc, the Oregon High Lava Plains and Brothers Fault Zone, and the northern Basin and Range Province, has been the site of geothermal exploration for more than 40 years. This has resulted in a unique resource: an extensive set of surficial and subsurface information appropriate to constrain the baseline structure of, and conditions within a high heat capacity magmatically hosted geothermal system.

In 2012 and 2014 AltaRock Energy conducted repeated stimulation of an enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) prospect along the western flank of the Newberry Volcano. A surface based monitoring effort was conducted independent of these stimulation attempts in both 2012 and 2014 through a collaboration between NETL, Oregon State University and Zonge International. This program included utilization of 3-D and 4-D magnetotelluric, InSAR, ground-based interferometric radar, and microgravity observations within and surrounding the planned EGS stimulation zone. These observations as well as borehole and microseismic stress field and location solutions provided by AltaRock and its collaborators, in combination with well logs, petrologic and geochemical data sets, LIDAR mapping of fault traces and extrusive volcanics, surficial geologic mapping and seismic tomography, have resulted in development of a framework, subsurface geologic model for Newberry Volcano.

The Newberry subsurface geologic model is a three-dimensional digital model constructed in EarthVision that enables lithology, directly and remotely measured material properties, and derived properties such as permeability, porosity and temperature, to be coregistered. This provides a powerful tool for characterizing and evaluating the sustainability of the site for EGS production and testing, particularly within the data-dense western portion of the volcano. The model has implications for understanding the previous EGS stimulations at Newberry as well as supporting future research and resource characterization opportunities. A portion of the Newberry area has been selected as a candidate site for the DOE FORGE (Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy) Program through a collaboration between Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Oregon State University, AltaRock Energy and additional partners. Thus, the conceptual geologic model presented here will support and benefit from future enhancements associated with that
effort. --Mark-Moser et al. 2016

 - Dataset: Establishing the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) on the Newberry Volcano, OR: The proposed Newberry Volcano FORGE site is in central Oregon on the northwest flank of the largest volcano in the Cascades volcanic arc. Beneath Newberry Volcano is one of the largest geothermal heat reservoirs in the western United States, extensively studied for the last 40 years. The large, shallow (200 deg C at less than 2 km depth), conductive thermal anomaly has already been well characterized by extensive drilling and geophysical surveys. Four deep (greater than 3,000 m) boreholes completed on the leasehold currently managed by AltaRock have conductive thermal gradients with bottom hole temperatures above 320 deg C. Three large geothermal pads and two deep geothermal wells exist on the leasehold as well as eight, 200-290 m deep monitoring boreholes that have been used for seismic monitoring and sampling of shallow groundwater. All these investments have built the scientific foundation that establishes the site as high EGS potential, demonstrates a record of addressing potential risks (induced seismicity, wildlife, groundwater, etc.), and has developed true support and engagement with the local and regional communities. The high temperatures at relatively shallow depths at the site will allow a greater variety of drilling methods to be tested and a greater share of funds to be reserved for non-drilling activities.

 - Dataset: Newberry EGS Demonstration Phase 2.2 Report: The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon, a 5 year project begun in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014. The second stimulation started September 23rd, 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with over 9,500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly (DIVA), which was the main modification to the original injection system design used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th, 2014 for 9 days with an additional 4,000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in injectivity, and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of flow zones near the bottom of the well.
 - Dataset: Newberry EGS Demonstration Phase 2.1 Report: The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon, a 3 year project started in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. Stimulation started October 17, 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Two TZIM treatments successfully shifted the depth of stimulation. Injectivity, DTS, and seismic analysis indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.

 - Dataset: Milford, Utah FORGE Temperature Contours at 200 m: The individual shapefiles in this dataset delineate estimated temperature contours (20, 40, 60, and 80) at a depth of 200 m in the Milford, Utah FORGE area.  Contours were derived from 86 geothermal, gradient, and other wells drilled in the area since the mid-1970s with depths greater than 50 m.  Conductive temperature profiles for wells less than 200 m were extrapolated to determine the temperature at the desired depth.  Because 11 wells in the eastern section of the study area (in and around the Mineral Mountains) are at higher elevations compared to those closer to the center of the basin, temperature profiles were extrapolated to a constant elevation of 200 m below the 1830 m (6000 ft) a.s.l. datum (approximate elevation of alluvial fans at the base of the Mineral Mountains) to smooth the contours across the ridges and valleys.

Collaborators included Cornell University, Southern Methodist University, and West Virginia University.  As a result of the research, 'play fairways' were identified for further study, based on four 'risk' criteria:  1) the Thermal Resource Quality, 2) the Natural Reservoir Quality, 3) the Risk of Seismic Activity, and the 4) Utilization Viability.  

In addition to the final report document, this submission includes project 'memos' referred to throughout the report.  Many of these same memos are also provided in the submission with the detailed data products accompanying the relevant risk factor (thermal, reservoir, seismicity, and utilization). 

A portion of the executive overview follows: 

Geothermal energy is an attractive sustainable energy source. Project developers need confirmation of the resource base to warrant their time and financial resources.  The hydrocarbon industry has addressed exploration and development complexities through use of a technique referred to as Play Fairway Analysis (PFA). The PFA technique assigns risk metrics that communicate the favorability of potential hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in order to enable prudent allocation of exploration and development resources.  
The purpose of this Department of Energy funded effort is to apply the PFA approach to geothermal exploration and development, thus providing a technique for Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis (GPFA). This project focuses on four risk factors of concern for direct-use geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin (AB) portions of New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia (Figure 1). These risk factors are 1) thermal resource quality, 2) natural reservoir quality, 3) induced seismicity, and 4) utilization opportunities (Figure 2).  This research expands upon and updates methodologies used in previous assessments of the potential for geothermal fields and utilization in the Appalachian Basin, and also introduces novel approaches and metrics for quantification of geothermal reservoir productivity in sedimentary basins. Unique to this project are several methodologies for combining the risk factors into a single commensurate objective that communicates the estimated overall favorability of geothermal development. Uncertainty in the risk estimation is also quantified. Based on these metrics, geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin were identified as potentially viable for a variety of direct-use-heat applications. The methodologies developed in this project may be applied in other sedimentary basins as a foundation for low temperature (50-150 degC), direct use geothermal resource, risk, and uncertainty assessment. Through our identification of plays, this project reveals the potential for widespread assessment of low-temperature geothermal energy from sedimentary basins as an alternative to current heating sources that are unsustainable.
There is an important distinction in this Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis project as compared to hydrothermal projects: this Appalachian Basin analysis is focused on the direct use of the heat, rather than on electrical production. Lindal (1973) illuminated numerous industrial and other low-temperature applications of geothermal energy for which this analysis can be useful.  The major relationship to electricity is that direct-use applications reduce the electricity requirements for a region.  Even though all of the geothermal resources in the Appalachian Basin are low grade, the high population and high heating demand across New York, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia translate into economic advantages if geothermal direct-use heating replaces electricity-based heating. The advantage is derived from the high efficiency of extracting heat from geothermal fluids rather than converting the fluids to electricity (Tester et al., 2015).

 - Dataset: Thermal Drawdown-Induced Flow Channeling in a Single Fracture in EGS: The evolution of flow pattern along a single fracture and its effects on heat production is a fundamental problem in the assessments of engineered geothermal systems (EGS). The channelized flow pattern associated with ubiquitous heterogeneity in fracture aperture distribution causes non-uniform temperature decrease in the rock body, which makes the flow increasingly concentrated into some preferential paths through the action of thermal stress. This mechanism may cause rapid heat production deterioration of EGS reservoirs.
In this study, we investigated the effects of aperture heterogeneity on flow pattern evolution in a single fracture in a low-permeability crystalline formation. We developed a numerical model on the platform of GEOS to simulate the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical processes in a penny-shaped fracture accessed via an injection well and a production well. We find that aperture heterogeneity generally exacerbates flow channeling and reservoir performance generally decreases with longer correlation length of aperture field. The expected production life is highly variable (5 years to beyond 30 years) when the aperture correlation length is longer than 1/5 of the well distance, whereas a heterogeneous fracture behaves similar to a homogeneous one when the correlation length is much shorter than the well distance. Besides, the mean production life decreases with greater aperture standard deviation only when the correlation length is relatively long. Although flow channeling is inevitable, initial aperture fields and well locations that enable tortuous preferential paths tend to prolong heat production lives.

 - Dataset: Thermal Drawdown Induced Flow Channeling in Fractured Geothermal Reservoirs: Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering: We investigate the flow-channeling phenomenon caused by thermal drawdown in fractured geothermal reservoirs. A discrete fracture network-based, fully coupled thermal "hydrological" mechanical simulator is used to study the interactions between fluid flow, temperature change, and the associated rock deformation. The responses of a number of randomly generated 2D fracture networks that represent a variety of reservoir characteristics are simulated with various injection-production well distances. We find that flow channeling, namely flow concentration in cooled zones, is the inevitable fate of all the scenarios evaluated. We also identify a secondary geomechanical mechanism caused by the anisotropy in thermal stress that counteracts the primary mechanism of flow channeling. This new mechanism tends, to some extent, to result in a more diffuse flow distribution, although it is generally not strong enough to completely reverse flow channeling. We find that fracture intensity substantially affects the overall hydraulic impedance of the reservoir but increasing fracture intensity generally does not improve heat production performance. Increasing the injection-production well separation appears to be an effective means to prolong the production life of a reservoir.

 - Dataset: Appalachian Basin Play Fairway Analysis: Thermal Quality Analysis in Low-Temperature Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis (GPFA-AB): This collection of files are part of a larger dataset uploaded in support of Low Temperature Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis for the Appalachian Basin (GPFA-AB, DOE Project DE-EE0006726). Phase 1 of the GPFA-AB project identified potential Geothermal Play Fairways within the Appalachian basin of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New York.  This was accomplished through analysis of 4 key criteria: thermal quality, natural reservoir productivity, risk of seismicity, and heat utilization.  Each of these analyses represent a distinct project task, with the fifth task encompassing combination of the 4 risks factors.  Supporting data for all five tasks has been uploaded into the Geothermal Data Repository node of the National Geothermal Data System (NGDS). 

This submission comprises the data for Thermal Quality Analysis (project task 1) and includes all of the necessary shapefiles, rasters, datasets, code, and references to code repositories that were used to create the thermal resource and risk factor maps as part of the GPFA-AB project. The identified Geothermal Play Fairways are also provided with the larger dataset. Figures (.png) are provided as examples of the shapefiles and rasters. The regional standardized 1 square km grid used in the project is also provided as points (cell centers), polygons, and as a raster. Two ArcGIS toolboxes are available: 1) RegionalGridModels.tbx for creating resource and risk factor maps on the standardized grid, and 2) ThermalRiskFactorModels.tbx for use in making the thermal resource maps and cross sections. These toolboxes contain item description documentation for each model within the toolbox, and for the toolbox itself. This submission also contains three R scripts: 1) AddNewSeisFields.R to add seismic risk data to attribute tables of seismic risk, 2) StratifiedKrigingInterpolation.R for the interpolations used in the thermal resource analysis, and 3) LeaveOneOutCrossValidation.R for the cross validations used in the thermal interpolations.

Some file descriptions make reference to various 'memos'.  These are contained within the final report submitted October 16, 2015.   

Each zipped file in the submission contains an 'about' document describing the full Thermal Quality Analysis content available, along with key sources, authors, citation, use guidelines, and assumptions, with the specific file(s) contained within the .zip file  highlighted.

Collaborators included Cornell University, Southern Methodist University, and West Virginia University. As a result of the research, 'play fairways' were identified for further study, based on four risk criteria: 1) the Thermal Resource Quality, 2) the Natural Reservoir Quality, 3) the Risk of Seismic Activity, and the 4) Utilization Viability. 

In addition to the final report document, this submission includes project 'memos' referred to throughout the report. Many of these same memos are also provided in the submissions with the detailed data products accompanying the relevant risk factor (thermal, reservoir, seismicity, and utilization). This report updates a preliminary version submitted in late 2015 (Submission 559 - See "Reservoir Analysis 2015" below)

This file presents the Final Report and Supporting Documents for a Geothermal Play Fairway Analysis of the Appalachian Basin sectors of New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The purpose of this Department of Energy funded effort was to assess the potential for viable low temperature (50-150 degrees C) geothermal energy exploration and development using the methods of Play Fairway Analysis. The resources analyzed occur at depths of 1000 m and greater below the surface, and the application scenarios considered are for direct utilization of the heat. This report illustrates the lateral variability of each of the four risk criteria. This report also illustrates multiple alternative methods to combine those factors in order to communicate the estimated overall favorability of geothermal development. Uncertainty in the risk estimation is also quantified. Based on these metrics, geothermal plays in the Appalachian Basin were identified as potentially viable for a variety of direct-use-heat applications. The methodologies developed in this project and presented in this report may be applied in other sedimentary basins as a foundation for geothermal resource, risk, and uncertainty assessment. Accompanying this report is an Appendix that describes in greater detail the methods used in the analysis, and 17 other technical memos that document criteria, methods and decisions on which the final product was built.

The MATLAB modules used in conjunction with GEOPHIRES, the MATLAB data input file, the GEOPHIRES output data file, and an explanation of the software components have been provided. Results of the SLCOH analysis appear on 4 .png image files as mapped risk of heat utilization. For each of the 4 image (.png) files, there is an accompanying georeferenced TIF (.tif) file by the same name.
In addition to calculating SLCOH, this Task 4 also identified many sites that may be prospects for use of a geothermal district heating system, based on their size and industry, rather than on the SLCOH. An industry sorted listing of the sites (.xlsx) and a map of these sites plotted as a layer onto different iterations of maps combining the three geological risk factors (Thermal Quality, Natural Reservoir Quality, and Risk of Seismicity) has been provided. In addition to the 6 image (.png) files of the maps in this series, a shape (.shp) file and 7 associated files are included as well.

RPI is in units of liters per MegaPascal-second (L/MPa-s), quantified using permeability, thickness of formation, and depth. A higher RPI is more optimal. Coefficient of Variation (CV) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean RPI for each reservoir. A lower CV is more optimal. Details on these metrics can be found in the Reservoirs_Methodology_Memo.pdf uploaded to the Geothermal Data Repository Node of the NGDS in October of 2015.

 - Dataset: Newberry Well 55-29 Stimulation Data 2014: The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon, a 5 year project begun in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. An initial stimulation was conducted in 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Further analysis indicated a shallow casing leak and an unstable formation in the open hole. The well was repaired with a shallow casing tieback and perforated liner in the open hole and re-stimulated in 2014. The second stimulation started September 23rd, 2014 and continued for 3 weeks with over 9,500 m3 of water injected. The well was treated with several batches of newly tested TZIM diverter materials and a newly designed Diverter Injection Vessel Assembly (DIVA), which was the main modification to the original injection system design used in 2012. A second round of stimulation that included two perforation shots and additional batches of TZIM was conducted on November 11th, 2014 for 9 days with an additional 4,000 m3 of water injected. The stimulations resulted in a 3-4 fold increase in injectivity, and PTS data indicates partial blocking and creation of flow zones near the bottom of the well.

This submission includes all of the files and reports associated with the stimulation, pressure testing, and monitoring included in the scope of the project.

The original data were cut into hour long traces and processed by differentiating, removing the mean, removing the trend, applying a 1% taper, whitening, removing the mean and trend again, and converting to single bit traces.

The data were then correlated with those from other stations and stacked. The resulting files were then named according to the convention:

	STA1.STA2.CHAN1_CHAN2.NHOURS.stacked.sac
 
The days included are from records during 2013 (julian days, 200,220-229).

The ANC correlations were calculated on the raw data traces (without instrument corrections applied) to assess the quality of the signal as a function of frequency throughout the network. The data were recorded at 500 Hz. We observe high quality signals 30 Hz on all traces, and measurable signal up to 80 Hz on a subset of the traces.

 - Dataset: Geothermal Exploration of Newberry Volcano, Oregon Summary Report: Abstract:  Davenport Newberry (Davenport) has completed 8 years of exploration for geothermal energy on Newberry Volcano in central Oregon. Two deep exploration test wells were drilled by Davenport on the west flank of the volcano, one intersected a hydrothermal system; the other intersected isolated fractures with no hydrothermal interconnection. Both holes have bottom-hole temperatures near or above 315 deg C (600 deg F). Subsequent to deep test drilling an expanded exploration and evaluation program was initiated. These efforts have included reprocessing existing data, executing multiple geological, geophysical, geochemical programs, deep exploration test well drilling and shallow well drilling. The efforts over the last three years have been made possible through the DOE's facilitation of innovative geothermal exploration techniques. The combined results of the last 8 years have led to a better understanding of the history and complexity of Newberry Volcano and improved the design and interpretation of geophysical exploration techniques with regard to blind geothermal resources in volcanic terrain.

 - Dataset: Geologic Framework of Thermal Springs, Black Canyon, Nevada and Arizona: This report presents the geologic framework critical in understanding spring discharge and the hydrogeology in Black Canyon directly south of Lake Mead below Hoover Dam, Nevada and Arizona. Most of the springs are thermal 2 Geologic Framework of Thermal Springs, Black Canyon, Nevada and Arizona with temperatures as much as 45 degrees C. This study is part of a hydrogeologic and geochemical study of the Black Canyon thermal springs by the U.S. Geological Survey, funded by the National Park Service and National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program of the U.S. Geological Survey. The study consisted of (1) compilation of existing geologic mapping, augmented by new field geologic mapping and geochronology (Felger and others, 2014), (2) collection and analysis of structural data adjacent to the springs of interest (appendix 1; Anderson and Beard, 2011; Beard and others, 2011a), and (3) construction of regional cross sections (pl. 1). The most significant results identify faults, fracture zones, and rock characteristics that influence the hydrogeology of Black Canyon. Additional results include refinement of the volcanic stratigraphy based on field mapping and new geochronology. This report will be integrated into a companion hydrogeologic report that includes new geochemical and spring flow data that describes groundwater components of Black Canyon thermal springs (M. Moran, written commun, 2013).
 - Dataset: Testing for Controlled Rapid Pressurization: Borehole W1 is a NQ core hole drilled at our test site in Socorro.  The rock is rhyolite.   Borehole W1 which was used to test gas-gas explosive mixtures is 55 feet deep with casing (pinkish in the drawing) set to 35 feet.  The model is a representation of the borehole and the holes we cored around the central borehole after the test.  The brown colored core holes showed dye when we filled W1 with water and slightly pressurized it.  This indicates there was some path between W1 and the colored core hole.

 - Dataset: Reservoir Stimulation Optimization with Operational Monitoring for Creation of EGS: EGS field projects have not sustained production at rates greater than 1/2 of what is needed for economic viability. The primary limitation that makes commercial EGS infeasible is our current inability to cost-effectively create high-permeability reservoirs from impermeable, igneous rock within the 3,000-10,000 ft depth range. Our goal is to develop a novel fracturing fluid technology that maximizes reservoir permeability while reducing stimulation cost and environmental impact. Laboratory equipment development to advance laboratory characterization/monitoring is also a priority of this project to study and optimize the physicochemical properties of these fracturing fluids in a range of reservoir conditions. Barrier G is the primarily intended GTO barrier to be addressed as well as support addressing barriers D, E and I.

 - Dataset: Illite Dissolution Rates and Equation (100 to 280 deg C): The objective of this suite of experiments was to develop a useful kinetic dissolution expression for illite applicable over an expanded range of solution pH and temperature conditions representative of subsurface conditions in natural and/or engineered geothermal reservoirs.  Using our new data, the resulting rate equation is dependent on both pH and temperature and utilizes two specific dissolution mechanisms (a "neutral" and a "basic" mechanism). The form of this rate equation should be easily incorporated into most existing reactive transport codes for to predict rock-water interactions in EGS shear zones.

 - Dataset: Raw Neutron Scattering Data for Strain Measurement of Hydraulically Loaded Granite and Marble Samples in Triaxial Stress State: This entry contains raw data files from experiments performed on the Vulcan beamline at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using a pressure cell. Cylindrical granite and marble samples were subjected to confining pressures of either 0 psi or approximately 2500 psi and internal pressures of either 0 psi, 1500 psi or 2500 psi through a blind axial hole at the center of one end of the sample. The sample diameters were 1.5" and the sample lengths were 6". The blind hole was 0.25" in diameter and 3" deep. One set of experiments measured strains at points located circumferentially around the center of the sample with identical radii to determine if there was strain variability (this would not be expected for a homogeneous material based on the symmetry of loading). Another set of experiments measured load variation across the radius of the sample at a fixed axial and circumferential location. Raw neutron diffraction intensity files and experimental parameter descriptions are included.

 - Dataset: Applications of Fractured Continuum Model to Enhanced Geothermal System Heat Extraction Problems: This paper describes the applications of the fractured continuum model to the different enhanced geothermal systems reservoir conditions. The capability of the fractured continuum model to generate fracture characteristics expected in enhanced geothermal systems reservoir environments are demonstrated for single and multiple sets of fractures. Fracture characteristics are defined by fracture strike, dip, spacing, and aperture. This paper demonstrates how the fractured continuum model can be extended to represent continuous fractured features, such as long fractures, and the conditions in which the fracture density varies within the different depth intervals. Simulations of heat transport using different fracture settings were compared with regard to their heat extraction effectiveness. The best heat extraction was obtained in the case when fractures were horizontal. A conventional heat extraction scheme with vertical wells was compared to an alternative scheme with horizontal wells. The heat extraction with the horizontal wells was significantly better than with the vertical wells when the injector was at the bottom.

 - Dataset: Mapping Fracture Network Creation with Microseismicity During EGS Demonstrations: This a report for the project "Mapping Fracture Network Creation with Microseismicity During EGS Demonstrations". Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.

 - Dataset: Application of Neutron Imaging to Investigate Flow through Fractures for EGS: There is an ongoing effort at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop a unique experimental capability for investigating flow through porous and fractured media using neutron imaging techniques. This capability is expected to support numerous areas of investigation associated with flow processes relevant to EGS including, but not limited to: experimental visualization and measurement of velocity profiles and other flow characteristics to better inform reduced-order modeling of flow through fractures; laboratory scale validation of flow models and simulators; and a 'real-time' tool for studying geochemical rock/fluid interactions by noninvasively measuring material effects such as precipitation and dissolution in EGS-representative conditions.

Demonstrating the ability of the technique to generate useful quantitative data is the primary focus at this stage of the effort. Details of the experimental setup and neutron imaging technique will be discussed in this communication, including the description of a custom designed, high pressure, neutron scattering

 - Dataset: Development of a Neutron Diffraction Based Experimental Capability for Investigating Hydraulic Fractures for EGS-like Conditions: Understanding the relationship between stress state, strain state and fracture initiation and propagation is critical to the improvement of fracture simulation capability if it is to be used as a tool for guiding hydraulic fracturing operations. The development of fracture prediction tools is especially critical for geothermal applications such as EGS because the opportunities to build understanding empirically will be limited due to the high costs associated with field trials. There is a significant body of experimental work associated with hydraulic fracture investigation, but past efforts are typically hampered by an inability to accurately and comprehensively measure strains within the sample mass near critical regions of interest.

This work aims to develop non-destructive neutron diffraction based strain measurement techniques that can be used to interrogate the internal volume of geological specimens subjected to tri-axial stress states resembling geothermal application conditions. Demonstrating the ability of the technique to generate useful quantitative data is the primary focus at this stage of the effort. Details of the experimental setup and diffraction technique will be presented in this communication, including the description of a custom designed high-pressure, neutron scattering

 - Dataset: Geothermal Water Use: Life Cycle Water Consumption, Water Resource Assessment, and Water Policy Framework: This report examines life cycle water consumption for various geothermal technologies to better understand factors that affect water consumption across the life cycle (e.g., power plant cooling, belowground fluid losses) and to assess the potential water challenges that future geothermal power generation projects may face. Previous reports in this series quantified the life cycle freshwater requirements of geothermal power-generating systems, explored operational and environmental concerns related to the geochemical composition of geothermal fluids, and assessed future water demand by geothermal power plants according to growth projections for the industry. This report seeks to extend those analyses by including EGS flash, both as part of the life cycle analysis and water resource assessment. A regional water resource assessment based upon the life cycle results is also presented. Finally, the legal framework of water with respect to geothermal resources in the states with active geothermal development is also analyzed.

 - Dataset: Centralizer for Use in Well Completions: Well completions are an integral part of providing safe, reliable and continuous access to underground resources such as oil, gas and geothermal resources.  Completions are typically considered to be the final step of drilling engineering which includes processes such as setting casing, cementing, and perforating to reach the target formation.  Completions provide the conduit from the resource to the surface.  Although completions encompass a wide range of disciplines, several key factors ultimately determine the quality of the completion.  One of those is cementing and centralizing casing within the wellbore.

This white paper examines the current state of the art for centralizers in the context of well completions.  The paper will include an introductory primer on well completions to provide the framework for the centralizer discussions.  The types of centralizers currently available and how they are used will be discussed in addition to alternative centralizer techniques.

 - Dataset: Structural Controls of the Neal Hot Springs Geothermal System, Eastern Oregon: Detailed geologic mapping (1:24,000 scale), structural and geochemical analyses, and integration of available geophysical and well-field data were utilized to assess the structural controls of the Neal Hot Springs geothermal field in eastern Oregon. The geothermal field lies within the intersection of two regional grabens, the middle-late Miocene, north-trending, Oregon-Idaho graben and younger late Miocene to Holocene, northwest-trending, western Snake River Plain graben. It is marked by Neal Hot Springs, which effuse from opaline sinter mounds just north of Bully Creek. Production and injection wells, with temperatures up to 142 degrees C, intersect the Neal fault zone at depths of 680-1900 m and subsidiary faults within a relay ramp or step-over within the fault zone.

The stratigraphy at Neal correlates with four regional packages. Basement rocks, discovered in one well, are granite, tentatively correlated with Jurassic Olds Ferry-Izee terrane. Nonconformably above is a thick package of middle Miocene Columbia River Basalt Group lavas, regionally known as the basalt of Malheur Gorge. Conformably above are middle to late Miocene Oregon-Idaho graben lavas, volcaniclastics, fluvial and lacustrine rocks. Overlying are the youngest rocks at Neal, which are late Miocene to Pliocene, western Snake River Plain lacustrine, fluvial, and volcaniclastic rocks.

The structural framework at Neal is characterized by northerly to northweststriking normal faults, including the geothermally related Neal fault zone. Stress inversion of kinematic data reveal an extensional stress regime, including an interpreted younger, southwest-trending (~243 degrees), least principal stress and an older, west-trending (~265 degrees) least principal stress.

The geothermal field is bounded on the east by the Neal fault, a major, westdipping, north-northwest-striking, steeply dipping normal to oblique-slip fault, along which geothermal fluids ascend, and on the west by the concealed north-northweststriking, west-dipping Sugarloaf Butte fault. The Neal fault zone can be modeled into two structural settings: an interpreted older, left-stepping, normal-slip fault zone and a younger, oblique sinistral-normal zone, suggested by the earlier west-trending and later southwest-trending extensional stress regimes. Recent sinistral-normal displacement may have generated a small pull-apart basin in the Neal area and facilitated development of the geothermal system. 'Hard-linkage' between the Neal and Sugarloaf Butte faults occurs through concealed, west-northwest-striking faults, including the Cottonwood Creek subvertical fault, along which lateral fluid-flow is likely. An inferred northplunging fault intersection at the Neal Hot Springs likely controls the location of the hot springs and sinter terraces.

Young structural features are evident at Neal. The Neal fault zone cuts Quaternary fans and late Miocene lower and upper Bully Creek Formation sedimentary rocks. In addition, the geothermal field is 4 km west of the active, north- to northweststriking, normal-slip Cottonwood Mountain fault. Furthermore, the field is within several kilometers of recently detected seismicity. This, coupled with its active hot springs (~90 degrees C), opaline sinter mounds, and geothermal fluid flow, suggest that the geothermal field lies within an active (Quaternary), southward-terminating, left-stepping fault zone, which locally acts as a pull-apart basin with sinistral- and normal-slip components.

 - Dataset: Structural Controls of the Tuscarora Geothermal Field, Elko County, Nevada - MS Thesis: Detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and well data have been integrated to elucidate the stratigraphic framework and structural setting of the Tuscarora geothermal area. Tuscarora is an amagmatic geothermal system that lies in the northern part of the Basin and Range province, ~15 km southeast of the Snake River Plain and ~90 km northwest of Elko, Nevada. The Tuscarora area is dominated by late Eocene to middle Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks, all overlying Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. A geothermal power plant was constructed in 2011 and currently produces 18 MWe from an ~170 degrees C reservoir in metasedimentary rocks at a depth of ~1430 m. Analysis of drill core reveals that the subsurface geology is dominated to depths of ~700-1000 m by intracaldera deposits of the Eocene Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera, including blocks of basement-derived megabreccia. Furthermore, the Tertiary-Paleozoic nonconformity within the geothermal field has been recognized as the margin of this Eocene caldera. Structural relations combined with geochronologic data from previous studies indicate that Tuscarora has undergone extension since the late Eocene, with significant extension in the late Miocene-Pliocene to early Pleistocene. Kinematic analysis of fault slip data reveal an east-west-trending least principal paleostress direction, which probably reflects an earlier episode of Miocene extension.

Two distinct structural settings at different scales appear to control the geothermal field. The regional structural setting is a 10-km wide complexly faulted left step or relay ramp in the west-dipping range-bounding Independence-Bull Run Mountains normal fault system. Geothermal activity occurs within the step-over where sets of east- and west-dipping normal faults overlap in a northerly trending accommodation zone. The distribution of hot wells and hydrothermal surface features, including boiling springs, fumaroles, and siliceous sinter, indicate that the geothermal system is restricted to the narrow (< 1 km) axial part of the accommodation zone, where permeability is maintained at depth around complex fault intersections. Shallow up-flow appears to be focused along several closely spaced steeply west-dipping north-northeast-striking normal faults within the axial part of the accommodation zone. These faults are favorably oriented for extension and fluid flow under the present-day northwest-trending regional extension direction indicated by previous studies of GPS geodetic data, earthquake focal mechanisms, and kinematic data from late Quaternary faults.

The recognition of the axial part of an accommodation zone as a favorable structural setting for geothermal activity may be a useful exploration tool for development of drilling targets in extensional terranes, as well as for developing geologic models of known geothermal fields. Preliminary analysis of broad step-overs similar to Tuscarora reveals that geothermal activity occurs in a variety of subsidiary structural settings within these regions. In addition, the presence of several high-temperature systems in northeastern Nevada demonstrates the viability of electrical-grade geothermal activity in this region despite low present-day strain rates as indicated by GPS geodetic data. Geothermal exploration potential in northeastern Nevada may therefore be higher than previously recognized.

 - Dataset: Structural and Tectonic Controls of Geothermal Activity in the Basin and Range Province: We are conducting an inventory of structural settings of geothermal systems (>400 total) in the extensional to transtensional Great Basin region of the western USA. A system of NW-striking dextral faults known as the Walker Lane accommodates ~20% of the North American-Pacific plate motion in the western Great Basin and is intimately linked to N- to NNE-striking normal fault systems throughout the region. Overall, geothermal systems are concentrated in areas with the highest strain rates within or proximal to the eastern and western margins of the Great Basin, with the highest temperature systems clustering in transtensional areas of highest strain rate in the northwestern Great Basin.

Of the 250+ geothermal fields catalogued, step-overs or relay ramps in normal fault zones serve as the most favorable setting, hosting ~32% of the systems. Such areas have multiple, overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability. Other common settings include a) intersections between normal faults and strike-slip or oblique-slip faults (22%), where multiple minor faults connect major structures and fluids can flow readily through highly fractured, dilational quadrants, and b) normal fault terminations or tip-lines (22%), where horse-tailing generates closely-spaced faults and increased permeability. Other settings include accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing, oppositely dipping normal faults; 8%), major normal faults (6%), displacement transfer zones (5%), and pull-aparts in strike-slip faults (4%). In addition, Quaternary faults lie within or near most systems (e.g., Bell and Ramelli, 2007). The relative scarcity of geothermal systems along displacement-maxima of major normal faults may be due to reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes. Step-overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to long-term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways are more likely to remain open in networks of closely-spaced, breccia-dominated fractures.

 - Dataset: Structural Data for the Columbus Salt Marsh Geothermal Area - GIS Data: Shapefiles and spreadsheets of structural data, including attitudes of faults and strata and slip orientations of faults.
- Detailed geologic mapping of ~30 km2 was completed in the vicinity of the Columbus Marsh geothermal field to obtain critical structural data that would elucidate the structural controls of this field.
- Documenting E- to ENE-striking left lateral faults and N- to NNE-striking normal faults.
- Some faults cut Quaternary basalts.
- This field appears to occupy a displacement transfer zone near the eastern end of a system of left-lateral faults. ENE-striking sinistral faults diffuse into a system of N- to NNE-striking normal faults within the displacement transfer zone.
- Columbus Marsh therefore corresponds to an area of enhanced extension and contains a nexus of fault intersections, both conducive for geothermal activity.
 - Dataset: Slip and Dilation Tendency Analysis of the Tuscarora Geothermal Area: Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. 
The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:
Ts = T / on  (Morris et al., 1996).

Dilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:
Td = (o1-on) / (o1-o3)  (Ferrill et al., 1999). 

Slip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).
Slip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.

Stress Magnitudes and directions
Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). 

Slip and dilation tendency for the Tuscarora geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Dering, 2013). The Tuscarora area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Tuscarora area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Tuscarora is defined by a left-step in a major north- to-north northeast striking, west-dipping range-bounding normal fault system. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. Within the axial part of the accommodation zone several west-dipping, north northeast-striking faults are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including fault strands that are exploited for both production and injection for the Tuscarora geothermal power plant.

Slip and dilation tendency for the San Emidio geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped Tuscarora area (Rhodes, 2011). The San Emidio area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the San Emidio area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. This is consistent with the shmin determined through inversion of fault data by Rhodes (2011). Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Interesting, the San Emidio geothermal field lies in an area of primarily north striking faults, which have moderate dilation tendency and moderate to low slip tendency.

 - Dataset: Slip and Dilation Tendency Analysis of the Salt Wells Geothermal Area: Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. 
The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:
Ts = T / on  (Morris et al., 1996).

Dilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:
Td = (o1-on) / (o1-o3)  (Ferrill et al., 1999). 

Slip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).
Slip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.

Stress Magnitudes and directions
Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). 

Slip and dilation tendency for the Salt Wells geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped in the Bunejug Mountains quadrangle (Hinz et al., 2011). The Salt Wells area lies in the Basin and Range Province (N. Hinz personal comm.) As such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the Salt Wells area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 105, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Several such faults intersect in high density in the core of the accommodation zone in the Bunejug Mountains and local to the Salt Wells geothermal .

As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. 
The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:

Slip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).
Slip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions.

For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). 

Slip and dilation tendency analysis for the Patua geothermal system was calculated based on faults mapped in the Hazen Quadrangle (Faulds et al., 2011). Patua lies near the margin between the Basin and Range province, which is characterized by west-northwest directed extension and the Walker Lane province, characterized by west-northwest directed dextral shear. As such, the Patua area likely has been affected by tectonic stress associated with either or both of stress regimes over geologic time. In order to characterize this stress variation we calculated slip tendency at Patua for both normal faulting and strike slip faulting stress regimes. Based on examination of regional and local stress data (as explained above) we applied at shmin direction of 105 to Patua. Whether the vertical stress (sv) magnitude is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) a normal faulting stress regime or the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) magnitude is larger than the vertical stress (sv), a strike-slip faulting stress regime, has very little effect on the dilation tendency, which is controlled by the stresses acting normal to fault planes. As such the dilation tendency results for a strike-slip faulting stress regime and for a normal faulting stress regime are virtually identical, so we present one result for dilation tendency applicable to both strike-slip and normal faulting stress conditions along with slip tendency for both a normal faulting and a strike-slip faulting stress regime. Under these stress conditions, north-northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency. Under the strike-slip faulting stress regime, north-northwest and east-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault have the highest slip tendency, while under normal faulting conditions north northeast striking, 60 degrees dipping faults have the highest slip tendency.

 - Dataset: Slip and Dilation Tendency Analysis of Neal Hot Springs Geothermal Area: Slip and Dilation Tendency in focus areas
Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. 
The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:
Ts = T / on  (Morris et al., 1996).

Dilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:

For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). 

Based on inversion of fault kinematic data, Edwards (2013) interpreted that two discrete stress orientations are preserved at Neal Hot Springs. An older episode of east-west directed extension and a younger episode of southwest-northeast directed sinistral, oblique -normal extension. This interpretation is consistent with the evolution of Cenozoic tectonics in the region (Edwards, 2013). As such we applied a southwest-northeast (060) directed normal faulting stress regime, consistent with the younger extensional episode, to the Neal Hot Springs faults. 
Under these stress conditions northeast striking steeply dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to dilate and northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. Under these stress conditions, both the Neal Fault and Sugarloaf Butte faults area well-oriented for both slip and dilation and thus for fracture permeability. In addition, several subsidiary faults on the eastern side and within the step-over between the Neal fault and Sugarloaf Butte fault are well oriented for slip and dilation as well.

 - Dataset: Slip and Dilation Tendency Analysis of McGinness Hills Geothermal Area: Slip and Dilation Tendency in focus areas
Critically stressed fault segments have a relatively high likelihood of acting as fluid flow conduits (Sibson, 1994). As such, the tendency of a fault segment to slip (slip tendency; Ts; Morris et al., 1996) or to dilate (dilation tendency; Td; Ferrill et al., 1999) provides an indication of which faults or fault segments within a geothermal system are critically stressed and therefore likely to transmit geothermal fluids. 
The slip tendency of a surface is defined by the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on that surface:
Ts = T / on  (Morris et al., 1996).

Dilation tendency is defined by the stress acting normal to a given surface:
Td = (o1-on) / (o1-o3)  (Ferrill et al., 1999). 

Slip and dilation were calculated using 3DStress (Southwest Research Institute).
Slip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by ambient stress conditions. Values range from a maximum of 1, a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions to zero, a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate. Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the focus study areas at, McGinness Hills, Neal Hot Springs, Patua, Salt Wells, San Emidio, and Tuscarora on fault traces. As dip is not well constrained or unknown for many faults mapped in within these we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip tendency or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum tendency of each fault to slip or dilate. The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.

Stress Magnitudes and directions
Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005) as well as local stress information if applicable. For faults within these focus systems we applied either a normal faulting stress regime where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin) or strike-slip faulting stress regime where the maximum horizontal stress (shmax) is larger than the vertical stress (sv) which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (shmax >sv>shmin) depending on the general tectonic province of the system. Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46, which are consistent with complete and partial stress field determinations from Desert Peak, Coso, the Fallon area and Dixie valley (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2011; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012). 

Slip and dilation tendency for the McGinness Hills geothermal field was calculated based on the faults mapped McGinness Hills area (Siler 2012, unpublished). The McGinness Hills area lies in the Basin and Range Province, as such we applied a normal faulting stress regime to the McGinness area faults, with a minimum horizontal stress direction oriented 115, based on inspection of local and regional stress determinations, as explained above. Under these stress conditions north-northeast striking, steeply dipping fault segments have the highest dilation tendency, while north-northeast striking 60 degrees dipping fault segments have the highest tendency to slip. The McGinness Hills geothermal system is characterized by a left-step in a north-northeast striking west-dipping fault system within a north northeast striking accommodation zone. As such, the normal faults that define these two structures are well oriented for both slip and dilation, including the west dipping faults that are exploited for both production and injection. Interestingly, although there is pressure communication between production and injection wells at McGinness Hills (B. Delwiche, personal comm.) the northwest striking fault, which creates hard linkage between the production and injection locations, is poorly oriented for both slip and dilation and therefore unlikely to host permeability.

 - Dataset: 3D Model of the Tuscarora Geothermal Area: The Tuscarora geothermal system sits within a ~15 km wide left-step in a major west-dipping range-bounding normal fault system. The step over is defined by the Independence Mountains fault zone and the Bull Runs Mountains fault zone which overlap along strike. Strain is transferred between these major fault segments via and array of northerly striking normal faults with offsets of 10s to 100s of meters and strike lengths of less than 5 km. These faults within the step over are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than the range-bounding fault zones between which they reside. Faults within the broad step define an anticlinal accommodation zone wherein east-dipping faults mainly occupy western half of the accommodation zone and west-dipping faults lie in the eastern half of the accommodation zone. The 3D model of Tuscarora encompasses 70 small-offset normal faults that define the accommodation zone and a portion of the Independence Mountains fault zone, which dips beneath the geothermal field.  The geothermal system resides in the axial part of the accommodation, straddling the two fault dip domains. The Tuscarora 3D geologic model consists of 10 stratigraphic units. Unconsolidated Quaternary alluvium has eroded down into bedrock units, the youngest and stratigraphically highest bedrock units are middle Miocene rhyolite and dacite flows regionally correlated with the Jarbidge Rhyolite and modeled with uniform cumulative thickness of ~350 m. Underlying these lava flows are Eocene volcanic rocks of the Big Cottonwood Canyon caldera. These units are modeled as intracaldera deposits, including domes, flows, and thick ash deposits that change in thickness and locally pinch out. The Paleozoic basement of consists metasedimenary and metavolcanic rocks, dominated by argillite, siltstone, limestone, quartzite, and metabasalt of the Schoonover and Snow Canyon Formations. Paleozoic formations are lumped in a single basement unit in the model. Fault blocks in the eastern portion of the model are tilted 5-30 degrees toward the Independence Mountains fault zone. Fault blocks in the western portion of the model are tilted toward steeply east-dipping normal faults. These opposing fault block dips define a shallow extensional anticline. Geothermal production is from 4 closely-spaced wells, that exploit a west-dipping, NNE-striking fault zone near the axial part of the accommodation zone.
 - Dataset: 3D Model of the Neal Hot Springs Geothermal Area: The Neal Hot Springs geothermal system lies in a left-step in a north-striking, west-dipping normal fault system, consisting of the Neal Fault to the south and the Sugarloaf Butte Fault to the north (Edwards, 2013). The Neal Hot Springs 3D geologic model consists of 104 faults and 13 stratigraphic units. The stratigraphy is sub-horizontal to dipping <10 degrees and there is no predominant dip-direction. Geothermal production is exclusively from the Neal Fault south of, and within the step-over, while geothermal injection is into both the Neal Fault to the south of the step-over and faults within the step-over.
 - Dataset: 3D Model of the McGinness Hills Geothermal Area: The McGinness Hills geothermal system lies in a ~8.5 km wide, north-northeast trending accommodation zone defined by east-dipping normal faults bounding the Toiyabe Range to the west and west-dipping normal faults bounding the Simpson Park Mountains to the east. Within this broad accommodation zone lies a fault step-over defined by north-northeast striking, west-dipping normal faults which step to the left at roughly the latitude of the McGinness Hills geothermal system. The McGinness Hills 3D model consists of 9 geologic units and 41 faults. The basal geologic units are metasediments of the Ordovician Valmy and Vininni Formations (undifferentiated in the model) which are intruded by Jurassic granitic rocks. Unconformably overlying is a ~100s m-thick section of Tertiary andesitic lava flows and four Oligocene-to-Miocene ash-flow tuffs: The Rattlesnake Canyon Tuff, tuff of Sutcliffe, the Cambell Creek Tuff and the Nine Hill tuff. Overlying are sequences of pre-to-syn-extensional Quaternary alluvium and post-extensional Quaternary alluvium. 10-15 degrees eastward dip of the Tertiary stratigraphy is controlled by the predominant west-dipping fault set. Geothermal production comes from two west dipping normal faults in the northern limb of the step over. Injection is into west dipping faults in the southern limb of the step over. Production and injection sites are in hydrologic communication, but at a deep level, as the northwest striking fault that links the southern and northern limbs of the step-over has no permeability.

 - Dataset: Geothermal Life Cycle Calculator: This calculator is a handy tool for interested parties to estimate two key life cycle metrics, fossil energy consumption (Etot) and greenhouse gas emission (ghgtot) ratios, for geothermal electric power production. It is based solely on data developed by Argonne National Laboratory for DOE's Geothermal Technologies office. The calculator permits the user to explore the impact of a range of key geothermal power production parameters, including plant capacity, lifetime, capacity factor, geothermal technology, well numbers and depths, field exploration, and others on the two metrics just mentioned. Estimates of variations in the results are also available to the user.
 - Dataset: Gravity Survey of the Carson Sink - Data and Maps: A detailed gravity survey was carried out for the entire Carson Sink in western Nevada (Figure 1) through a subcontract to Zonge Engineering, Inc. The Carson Sink is a large composite basin containing three known, blind high-temperature geothermal systems (Fallon Airbase, Stillwater, and Soda Lake). This area was chosen for a detailed gravity survey in order to characterize the gravity signature of the known geothermal systems and to identify other potential blind systems based on the structural setting indicated by the gravity data.

Data were acquired at approximately 400, 800, and 1600 meter intervals for a total of 1,243 stations. The project location and station location points are presented in Figure 14. The station distribution for this survey was designed to complete regional gravity coverage in the Carson Sink area without duplication of available public and private gravity coverage. Gravity data were acquired using a Scintrex CG-5 gravimeter and a LaCoste and Romberg (L&R) Model-G gravimeter. The CG-5 gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.001 milligals and a typical repeatability of less than 0.005 milligals. The L&R gravity meter has a reading resolution of 0.01 milligals and a typical repeatability of 0.02 milligals. The basic processing of gravimeter readings to calculate through to the Complete Bouguer Anomaly was made using the Gravity and Terrain Correction software version 7.1 for Oasis Montaj by Geosoft LTD.

The gravity survey of the Carson Sink yielded a project location and station location map, a Complete Bouguer Anomaly @ 2.67 gm/cc reduction density, a Gravity Complete Bouguer Anomaly at 2.50 g/cc Contour Map, a Gravity Horizontal Gradient Magnitude Shaded Color Contour Map, a Gravity 1st Vertical Derivative Color Contour Map, and an Interpreted Depth to Mesozoic Basement incorporating drill-hole intercept values.

A preliminary interpretation of these results suggests that the Carson Sink is a complex composite basin with several major depocenters. Major depocenters are present in the south-central, east-central, and northeastern parts of the basin. The distribution of gravity anomalies suggests a complex pattern of faulting in the subsurface of the basin, with many fault terminations, step-overs, and accommodation zones. The pattern of faulting implies that other, previously undiscovered blind geothermal systems are likely in the Carson Sink. The gravity survey was completed near the end of this project. Thus, more thorough analysis of the data and potential locations of blind geothermal systems is planned for future work.

Structural controls of 426 geothermal systems were analyzed with literature research, air photos, Google Earth imagery, and/or field reviews (Figures 1 and 2). Of the systems analyzed, we were able to determine the structural settings of more than 240 sites. However, we found that many "systems" consisted of little more than a warm or hot well in the central part of a basin. Such "systems" were difficult to evaluate in terms of structural setting in areas lacking in geophysical data.

Developed database for structural catalogue in a master spreadsheet. Data components include structural setting, primary fault orientation, presence or absence of Quaternary faulting, reservoir lithology, geothermometry, presence or absence of recent magmatism, and distinguishing blind systems from those that have surface expressions.

Reviewed site locations for all 426 geothermal systems confirmed and/or relocated spring and geothermal sites based on imagery, maps, and other information for master database. Many systems were mislocated in the original database. In addition, some systems that included several separate springs spread over large areas were divided into two or more distinct systems. Further, all hot wells were assigned names based on their location to facilitate subsequent analyses.

We catalogued systems into the following eight major groups, based on the dominant pattern of faulting (Figure 1):
- Major normal fault segments (i.e., near displacement maxima).
- Fault bends.
- Fault terminations or tips.
- Step-overs or relay ramps in normal faults.
- Fault intersections.
- Accommodation zones (i.e., belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults),
- Displacement transfer zones whereby strike-slip faults terminate in arrays of normal faults.
- Transtensional pull-aparts.

These settings form a hierarchal pattern with respect to fault complexity.
- Major normal faults and fault bends are the simplest.
- Fault terminations are typically more complex than mid-segments, as faults commonly break up into multiple strands or horsetail near their ends.
- A fault intersection is generally more complex, as it generally contains both multiple fault strands and can include discrete dilational quadrants.
- A step-over consists of two overlapping fault terminations and thus involves additional complexity, especially where the relay ramp is breached by multiple fault splays between the main overlapping faults and thus contains multiple fault intersections.
- Accommodation zones involve further complexity, as they contain multiple fault terminations and fault intersections.

Of the 426 fields analyzed, major findings include (Figures 1 and 2):
- 39% of the known systems are blind or hidden (Figure 1), with no surface hot springs or fumaroles.
- The structural setting for ~25% of the systems could not be determined (Figure 2). In most cases, undetermined systems reside in the central part of a basin (commonly warm wells) that lacks adequate geophysical data for elucidating the subsurface structure.
- Step-overs or relay ramps in normal faults are the most favorable setting (Figure 2), hosting ~32% of the systems analyzed. Such areas are characterized by multiple, commonly overlapping fault strands, increased fracture density, and thus enhanced permeability.
- Normal fault terminations host 25%.
- Intersections of normal faults and strike-slip or oblique-slip faults host 22%.
- Accommodation zones (belts of intermeshing oppositely dipping normal faults) host 9%.
- Displacement transfer zones host 5%.
- Pull-aparts in strike-slip faults host 3%.
- Bends in major normal faults host 2%.
- Major range-front faults host 1% of the known systems.
Some of the more robust systems contain more than one type of structural setting. These include Steamboat, Coso, and Dixie Valley. About 21% of the fields are hybrid or compound systems.

Pull-aparts and displacement transfer zones are more abundant in the transtensional western part of the Great Basin.

An analysis of the relations between Quaternary faulting and geothermal systems was completed for the Great Basin region. The 426 localities were overlain on USGS Quaternary fault database in Google Earth to evaluate proximity to mapped faults and look for unrecognized faults.
- Quaternary faults typically lie within or near most of the geothermal systems.
- Geothermal fields were evaluated with proximity to Quaternary faults classified in 4 categories: <1 km, 1-2 km, 1-5 km, 1-10 km.
- Fault ages were classified as historical, Holocene, late Pleistocene, mid-Pleistocene, and Quaternary undivided.
- The highest percentage of high-temp sites are within 2 km of Quaternary faults. This suggests a statistical correlation between proximity to active faults and high-temp resources.

Geothermal systems are rare along major range-front faults, possibly due to both reduced permeability in thick zones of clay gouge and periodic release of stress in major earthquakes.

Step-overs, terminations, intersections, and accommodation zones correspond to long-term, critically stressed areas, where fluid pathways would more likely remain open in networks of closely-spaced, breccia-dominated fractures.

 - Dataset: Developing Successful Exploration Strategies in Extended Terranes: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the structural controls of geothermal systems within the Great Basin and adjacent regions. Our main objectives were to: 
1) Produce a catalogue of favorable structural environments and models for geothermal systems. 
2) Improve site-specific targeting of geothermal resources through detailed studies of representative sites, which included innovative techniques of slip tendency analysis of faults and 3D modeling. 
3) Compare and contrast the structural controls and models in different tectonic settings.
4) Synthesize data and develop methodologies for enhancement of exploration strategies for conventional and EGS systems, reduction in the risk of drilling non-productive wells, and selecting the best EGS sites.

Phase I (Year 1) involved a broad inventory of structural settings of geothermal systems in the Great Basin, Walker Lane, and southern Cascades, with the aim of developing conceptual structural models and a structural catalogue of the most favorable structural environments. This overview permitted selection of 5-6 representative sites for more detailed studies in Years 2 and 3. Sites were selected on the basis of quality of exposure, potential for development, availability of subsurface data, and type of
system, so that major types of systems can be evaluated and compared. The detailed investigations included geologic mapping, kinematic analysis, stress determinations, gravity surveys, integration of available geophysical data, slip tendency analysis, and for some areas 3D modeling. In Year 3, the detailed studies were completed and data synthesized to a) compare structural controls in various tectonic settings, b) complete the structural catalogue, and c) apply knowledge to exploration strategies and selection of drilling sites.
 - Dataset: Regional Slip Tendency Analysis of the Great Basin Region: Slip and dilation tendency on the Great Basin fault surfaces (from the USGS Quaternary Fault Database) were calculated using 3DStress (software produced by Southwest Research Institute).

Slip and dilation tendency are both unitless ratios of the resolved stresses applied to the fault plane by the measured ambient stress field.
- Values range from a maximum of 1 (a fault plane ideally oriented to slip or dilate under ambient stress conditions) to zero (a fault plane with no potential to slip or dilate).
- Slip and dilation tendency values were calculated for each fault in the Great Basin. As dip is unknown for many faults in the USGS Quaternary Fault Database, we made these calculations using the dip for each fault that would yield the maximum slip or dilation tendency. As such, these results should be viewed as maximum slip and dilation tendency.
- The resulting along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in slip or dilation potential is a proxy for along-fault and fault-to-fault variation in fluid flow conduit potential.

Stress Magnitudes and directions were calculated across the entire Great Basin. Stress field variation within each focus area was approximated based on regional published data and the world stress database (Hickman et al., 2000; Hickman et al., 1998 Robertson-Tait et al., 2004; Hickman and Davatzes, 2010; Davatzes and Hickman, 2006; Blake and Davatzes 2011; Blake and Davatzes, 2012; Moeck et al., 2010; Moos and Ronne, 2010 and Reinecker et al., 2005).

The minimum horizontal stress direction (Shmin) was contoured, and spatial bins with common Shmin directions were calculated. Based on this technique, we subdivided the Great Basin into nine regions (Shmin <070, 070<Shmin<080, 080<Shmin<090, 090<Shmin<100, 100<Shmin<110, 110<Shmin<120, 120<Shmin<130, 130<Shmin<140, Shmin>140). Slip and dilation tendency were calculated using 3DStress for the faults within each region using the mean Shmin for the region. Shmin variation throughout Great Basin are shown on Figure 3.

For faults within the Great Basin proper, we applied a normal faulting stress regime, where the vertical stress (sv) is larger than the maximum horizontal stress (shmax), which is larger than the minimum horizontal stress (sv>shmax>shmin). Based on visual inspection of the limited stress magnitude data in the Great Basin, we used magnitudes such that shmin/shmax = .527 and shmin/sv= .46. These values are consistent with stress magnitude data at both Dixie Valley (Hickman et al., 2000) and Yucca Mountain (Stock et al., 1985).

For faults within the Walker Lane/Eastern California Shear Zone, we applied a strike-slip faulting stress, where shmax > sv > shmin. Upon visual inspection of limited stress magnitude data from the Walker Lane and Eastern California Shear zone, we chose values such that SHmin/SHmax = .46 and Shmin/Sv= .527 representative of the region. 

Results: The results of our slip and dilation tendency analysis are shown in Figures 4 (dilation tendency), 5 (slip tendency) and 6 (slip tendency + dilation tendency). Shmin varies from northwest to east-west trending throughout much of the Great Basin. As such, north- to northeast-striking faults have the highest tendency to slip and to dilate, depending on the local trend of shmin. These results provide a first order filter on faults and fault systems in the Great Basin, affording focusing of local-scale exploration efforts for blind or hidden geothermal resources.

 - Dataset: Greenhouse Gas emissions from California Geothermal Power Plants: The information given in this file represents greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and corresponding emission rates for California flash and dry steam geothermal power plants. This stage of the life cycle is the fuel use component of the fuel cycle and arises during plant operation. Despite the fact that no fossil fuels are being consumed during operation of these plants, GHG emissions nevertheless arise from GHGs present in the geofluids and dry steam that get released to the atmosphere upon passing through the system. Data for the years of 2008 to 2012 are analyzed.			
										
										
										
										

 - Dataset: Alternative Geothermal Power Production Scenarios: The information given in this file pertains to Argonne life-cycle analyses (LCAs) of the plant cycle stage for a set of ten new geothermal scenario pairs, each comprised of a reference and improved case. These analyses were conducted to compare environmental performances among the scenarios and cases. The types of plants evaluated are hydrothermal binary and flash and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) binary and flash plants. Each scenario pair was developed by the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) group using the Geothermal Electricity Evaluation Model (GETEM) as a way to identify plant operational and resource combinations that could reduce geothermal power plant LCOE values. Based on the specified plant and well field characteristics (plant type, capacity, capacity factor and lifetime, and well numbers and depths) for each case of each pair, Argonne generated a corresponding set of material to power ratios (MPRs) and greenhouse gas and fossil energy ratios.

 - Dataset: A Class III Cultural Resources Inventory of Proposed Roads and Drill Pads for the McGee Mountain Geothermal Project, Humboldt County, Nevada: From July 20th to July 22nd, 2010, Chambers Group personnel conducted a cultural resources inventory of the project area. The recordation and inventory resulted in the recordation a single newly identified prehistoric site (CrNV-2-9605) and five isolated finds (CrNV-2-1490 to 1494). The prehistoric site is a small lithic scatter composed exclusively of chalcedony with two formed tools. CrNV-2-9605 is recommended as not eligible to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under all Criterion. The isolated finds consist of a single prehistoric flake and four pieces of historic debris. All of the isolated finds are categorically not eligible for the NRHP per the State Protocol Agreement between the BLM and Nevada SHPO. The report included in this submission details the findings  of the study.

 - Dataset: Geothermal Resource at the McGee Mountain Prospect, Humboldt County, Nevada: This report describes the geothermal resource at McGee Mountain, including:
1. Local geology
2. Thermal features
3. Known boreholes and temperature gradients
4. Geophysical surveys
5. Fluid geochemistry and geothermometry
6. Estimate of the heat-in-place

Description of the heat-in-place estimate:
The magnitude of the geothermal resource at McGee Mountain (Painted Hills) has been estimated using a Monte Carlo method applied to estimating heat-in-place. The method relies (along with certain other parameters) on estimates of the area, thickness and average temperature of the resource, but among these, only area has some constraint at this time. Therefore, the estimates used for thickness and temperature have been based on the characteristics of other
geothermal resources in Nevada.

Results yield a 90%-probable ("P90") thermal energy-in-place estimate of 87,300 MWth-years (that is, 90% of estimates are higher). We consider this to be a minimum likely value. At 50% probability ("P50") the estimate is 134,000 MWth-years. The recoverable portion of the preceding estimate of energy-in-place has also been estimated and converted into electrical energy, using values of recovery factor, rejection temperature, utilization factor, plant capacity factor and power plant life that are provided. The minimum (90% probable) estimate for generation potential is about 25 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 750 MWe-years) and at 50% probability the estimate is 52 MWe for 30 years (or a total of 1,560 MWe-years). These estimates are somewhat larger than a public-domain McGee resource estimate made by GeothermEx in 2004, because a 2-m deep temperature survey by Caldera has established continuance of the thermal anomaly about a half mile further north than previously documented.

This resource estimate was made without reference to the Caldera property (project area) boundary, but it is likely that the entire magnitude of estimated resource lies within it. The estimate should be regarded with caution because there needs to be subsequent proof of area, thickness, temperature and commercial permeability by means of deep drilling and testing. No heat-in-place estimate of this type should ever be used to determine the final, installed size of a well field and power plant.

 - Dataset: Effectiveness of Shallow Temperature Surveys to Target a Geothermal Reservoir at Previously Explored Site at McGee Mountain, Nevada: Final Report for U.S. Department Of Energy Grant EE-0002830: The McGee Mountain geothermal area was selected  to test early-stage shallow temperature survey techniques and drill two slim holes to test the resource. Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc. was able to complete only a small portion of the project before lack of funding prevented further exploration work. This work included a shallow (2-meter) temperature survey, a Geoprobe survey, a close-spaced gravity survey, and several reports on geologic and transmission viability.

The 18-page report includes a description of the geothermal geology of the area, geochemistry and geothermometry of nearby springs and wells, and findings from the shallow temperature survey, Geoprobe survey, close-spaced gravity survey, heat-in-place estimate, transmission viability, and an archeological survey. The report makes the following conclusions:

Both the shallow 2-meter and the Geoprobe surveys are cost-effective methods to detect subsurface thermal anomalies in early-stage exploration, prior to more expensive temperature gradient drilling.
The major advantages of the 2-meter survey are its extreme portability (no roads needed), cost per site measurement, and low environmental impact.
The 2-meter survey's disadvantages are its inability to penetrate hard substrates and the noise effects due to solar heating of the ground.
The Geoprobe's advantages are its ability to collect temperature and uncontaminated water samples, greater depth of penetration (to 60m), relatively low cost, and low environmental impact.
The Geoprobe's disadvantages are its inability to go off-road or to penetrate hard substrates.
Costs to perform both types of surveys are low, together less than the cost of one conventional temperature gradient well. Given the potential increase in data that these surveys can provide, this is extreme value for the exploration dollar.

 - Dataset: Penrose Well Temperatures: Penrose Well Temperatures

Geothermal waters have been encountered in several wells near Penrose in Fremont County, Colorado. Most of the wells were drilled for oil and gas exploration and, in a few cases, production.

This ESRI point shapefile utilizes data from 95 wells in and around the Penrose area provided by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) database at   http://cogcc.state.co.us/ . Temperature data from the database were used to calculate a temperature gradient for each well. This information was then used to estimate temperatures at various depths.

 - Dataset: Ground Magnetic Data for West-Central Colorado: Modeled ground magnetic data was extracted from the Pan American Center for Earth and Environmental Studies database at http://irpsrvgis08.utep.edu/viewers/Flex/GravityMagnetic/GravityMagnetic_CyberShare/ on 2/29/2012. The downloaded text file was then imported into an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet data was converted into an ESRI point shapefile in UTM Zone 13 NAD27 projection, showing location and magnetic field strength in nano-Teslas. This point shapefile was then interpolated to an ESRI grid using an inverse-distance weighting method, using ESRI Spatial Analyst. The grid was used to create a contour map of magnetic field strength.

The downloaded text file was opened in an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet data was then converted into an ESRI point shapefile in UTM Zone 13 NAD27 projection, showing location and gravity (in milligals). This data was then converted to grid and then contoured using ESRI Spatial Analyst.

 - Dataset: Spatial Analysis of CIRES ASTER and LANDSAT thermal infrared anomalies: CIRES provided polygon shapefiles showing areas of anomalously warm ground, derived from ASTER and LANDSAT remotely sensed thermal infrared imagery. Partly from these anomalies, and partly through other evidence layers, CIRES came up with 'polygons' representing areas prospective for geothermal development. Many of the anomalies are much larger and of different shapes than typical geothermal outflow zones, and many occur on ridgetops or other places geothermal systems typically do not form. This might indicate that the thermal anomalies are mostly solar (not geothermal) in nature.

The purpose of this analysis is to construct some spatial statistics to help understand the viability of the CIRES target model. In this model, ground thermal anomalies in Colorado are detected using either ASTER or LANDSAT thermal infrared spectral bands (among others). Those areas above some anomaly threshold (1 and 2 standard deviations) were then designated as "anomalous." One way to test the viability of their model would be to examine the area spatial statistics make use of the relative area of anomaly versus the total area, and the relative proportion of overlap between ASTER and LANDSAT data. If the area considered to be anomalous is large compared to the total area, then the infrared imagery would be a "blunt tool" for finding geothermal systems: the search is confined to too large an area. If there is disagreement between the areas found to be anomalous by ASTER and the areas found to be anomalous by LANDSAT, then the technique might not be robust. 

To do this, ESRI Spatial Analyst was used to convert all of the anomaly shapefiles into ESRI grids with a 100m cell size. The the total area of the target polygons as well as the areas of ASTER and LANDSAT anomaly were calculated. Finally, the area of overlap between the ASTER and LANDSAT anomalies in a given polygon area was calculated.

 - Dataset: Memos Relating to High-Priority Geothermal Targets in Colorado Selected for Further Study - Flint Geothermal 2012: This dataset contains several memos describing geothermal targets outlined by Flint personnel in Colorado. Phase 1 involved an ASTER and LANDSAT thermal infrared imagery assessment conducted by CIRES of the University of Colorado, which identified areas of warm ground that might indicate geothermal heating. CIRES used the thermal ground anomalies, together with other GIS layers, to come up with a set of areas ("polygons") having high geothermal potential. 

This was followed by a "ground truthing" or site assessment by Geothermal Development Associates of Reno Nevada, during the summer and fall of 2011. Of the many areas targeted and visited, several stood out for their overall geothermal potential.

In the first memo, "Colorado Targets", GDA's Richard "Rick" Zehner describes the geothermal geology of the following properties, which were deemed to have the highest geothermal potential:
1. Routt (aka Strawberry Park) Hot Springs in Routt County;
2. Rico area, Delores County;
3. Pagosa Springs, Archuleta County;
4. San Luis Valley, Alamosa and Conejos Counties;
5. Lemon Hot Springs, San Miguel County

The second memo, "Comments on Rick's Report", from CIRES investigators, is a critical evaluation of Zehner's memo, in relation to CIRES' satellite thermal anomaly maps.

The third memo, "Penrose Area" is a detailed description of preliminary investigations into the geothermal potential of that area in Fremont County.

 - Dataset: CIRES Approach Overview to Using Thermal Infrared Imagery to Find Geothermal Systems in Colorado: Subsurface geothermal activity has a thermal expression that can be observed at the surface.  Such spatial temperature gradients are within the radiometric resolution that is characteristic of a wide range of satellites that carry thermal sensors.  For this effort, CIRES (part of the University of Colorado) used a hierarchical approach in which we examined data from Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) onboard Landsat platforms and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard the Terra satellite to digitally model warm surface exposures. Geological characteristics such as faulting and other available datasets for known thermally active areas in Colorado were used in conjunction with the satellite thermal imagery to rank potential areas of geothermal activity.

 - Dataset: Geothermal Target Areas in Colorado as Identified by Remote Sensing Techniques: This layer contains the areas identified as targets of potential geothermal activity.

 - Dataset: Remotely Sensed Thermal Anomalies in Western Colorado: This layer contains the areas identified as areas of anomalous surface temperature from Landsat satellite imagery in Western Colorado. Data was obtained for two different dates. The digital numbers of each Landsat scene were converted to radiance and the temperature was calculated in degrees Kelvin and then converted to degrees Celsius for each land cover type using the emissivity of that cover type. And this process was repeated for each of the land cover types (open water, barren, deciduous forest and evergreen forest, mixed forest, shrub/scrub, grassland/herbaceous, pasture hay, and cultivated crops). The temperature of each pixel within each scene was calculated using the thermal band. In order to calculate the temperature an average emissivity value was used for each land cover type within each scene. The NLCD 2001 land cover classification raster data of the zones that cover Colorado were downloaded from USGS site and used to identify the land cover types within each scene. Areas that had temperature residual greater than 2o, and areas with temperature equal to 1o to 2o, were considered Landsat modeled very warm and warm surface exposures (thermal anomalies), respectively.

 - Dataset: Favorable Geochemistry from Springs and Wells in Colorado: This layer contains favorable geochemistry for high-temperature geothermal systems, as interpreted by Richard "Rick" Zehner. The data is compiled from the data obtained from the USGS. The original data set combines 15,622 samples collected in the State of Colorado from several sources including 1) the original Geotherm geochemical database, 2) USGS NWIS (National Water Information System), 3) Colorado Geological Survey geothermal sample data, and 4) original samples collected by R. Zehner at various sites during the 2011 field season. These samples are also available in a separate shapefile FlintWaterSamples.shp. Data from all samples were reportedly collected using standard water sampling protocols (filtering through 0.45 micron filter, etc.) Sample information was standardized to ppm (micrograms/liter) in spreadsheet columns. Commonly-used cation and silica geothermometer temperature estimates are included.

 - Dataset: Colorado Potential Geothermal Pathways: This layer contains the weakened basement rocks. Isostatic gravity was utilized to identify structural basin areas, characterized by gravity low values reflecting weakened basement rocks. Together interpreted regional fault zones and basin outlines define geothermal "exploration fairways", where the potential exists for deep, superheated fluid flow in the absence of Pliocene or younger volcanic units.

 - Dataset: Colorado Heat Flow Data from IHFC: This layer contains the heat flow sites and data of the State of Colorado compiled from the International Heat Flow Commission (IHFC) of the International Association of Seismology and Physics of the Earth's Interior (IASPEI) global heat flow database (www.heatflow.und.edu/index2.html). The data include different items: Item number, descriptive code, name of site, latitude and longitude, elevation, depth interval, number of temperature data, temperature gradient, number of conductivity measurement, average conductivity, number of heat generation measurements, average heat production, heat flow, number of individual sites, references, and date of publication.

 - Dataset: Shallow (2-meter) Temperature Surveys in Colorado: Shallow temperature surveys are useful in early-stage geothermal exploration to delineate surface outflow zones, with the intent to identify the source of upwelling, usually a fault. Detailed descriptions of the 2-meter survey method and equipment design can be found in Coolbaugh et al. (2007) and Sladek et al. (2007), and are summarized here.

The survey method was devised to measure temperature as far below the zone of solar influence as possible, have minimal equilibration time, and yet be portable enough to fit on the back of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV); Figure 2). This method utilizes a direct push technology (DPT) technique where 2.3 m long, 0.54" outer diameter hollow steel rods are pounded into the ground using a demolition hammer. Resistance temperature devices (RTD) are then inserted into the rods at 2-meter depths, and allowed to equilibrate for one hour. The temperatures are then measured and recorded, the rods pulled out of the ground, and re-used at future sites. Usually multiple rods are planted over the course of an hour, and then the sampler returns back to the first station, measures the temperatures, pulls the rods, and so on, to eliminate waiting time.

At Wagon Wheel Gap, 32 rods were planted around the hot springs between June 20 and July 1, 2012. The purpose was to determine the direction of a possible upflow fault or other structure. Temperatures at 1.5m and 2m depths were measured and recorded in the attribute table of this point shapefile. Several anomalous temperatures suggest that outflow is coming from a ~N60W striking fault or shear zone that contains the quartz-fluorite-barite veins of the adjacent patented mining claims.

It should be noted that temperatures at 2m depth vary according to the amount of solar heating from above, as well as possible geothermal heating from below.

 - Dataset: Archuleta County CO Lineaments: This layer traces apparent topographic and air-photo lineaments in the area around Pagosa springs in Archuleta County, Colorado. It was made in order to identify possible fault and fracture systems that might be conduits for geothermal fluids.
Geothermal fluids commonly utilize fault and fractures in competent rocks as conduits for fluid flow. Geothermal exploration involves finding areas of high near-surface temperature gradients, along with a suitable plumbing system that can provide the necessary permeability. Geothermal power plants can sometimes be built where temperature and flow rates are high.

To do this, georeferenced topographic maps and aerial photographs were utilized in an existing GIS, using ESRI ArcMap 10.0 software. The USA_Topo_Maps and World_Imagery map layers were chosen from the GIS Server at server.arcgisonline.com, using a UTM Zone 13 NAD27 projection. This line shapefile was then constructed over that which appeared to be through-going structural lineaments in both the aerial photographs and topographic layers, taking care to avoid manmade features such as roads, fence lines, and right-of-ways. These lineaments may be displaced somewhat from their actual location, due to such factors as shadow effects with low sun angles in the aerial photographs.

Note: This shape file was constructed as an aid to geothermal exploration in preparation for a site visit for field checking. We make no claims as to the existence of the lineaments, their location, orientation, and nature.

 - Dataset: High-Pressure Combustion and Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Ethylene/Nitrous Oxide Mixtures: In this paper, the combustion of nitrous oxide with a simple hydrocarbon, ethylene, at high initial pressures is investigated.  A series of experiments were conducted using a stoichiometric C2H4-N2O mixture in a round, smooth-walled tube with initial pressures of 125 to 337 psi.  A low-energy ignition mechanism (heated wire) to prevent direct initiation of a detonation, and the flame acceleration and subsequent deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) was observed.  According to Joannon (1991), one of the critical parameters that determines the detonability of given gas mixture is the initial pressure, and so the effect of pressure on DDT was examined.

 - Dataset: Newberry EGS Seismic Velocity Model: We use ambient noise correlation (ANC) to create a detailed image of the subsurface seismic velocity at the Newberry EGS site down to 5 km. We collected continuous data for the 22 stations in the Newberry network, together with 12 additional stations from the nearby CC, UO and UW networks. The data were instrument corrected, whitened and converted to single bit traces before cross correlation according to the methodology in Benson (2007). There are 231 unique paths connecting the 22 stations of the Newberry network. The additional networks extended that to 402 unique paths crossing beneath the Newberry site. 
 - Dataset: Improved Microseismicity Detection During Newberry EGS Stimulations: Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation. Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.

 - Dataset: Dixie Valley Engineered Geothermal System Exploration Methodology Project, Baseline Conceptual Model Report: The Engineered Geothermal System (EGS) Exploration Methodology Project is developing an exploration approach for EGS through the integration of geoscientific data. The overall project area is 2500km2 with the Calibration Area (Dixie Valley Geothermal Wellfield) being about 170km2. 

The Final Scientific Report (FSR) is submitted in two parts (I and II).

FSR part I presents (1) an assessment of the readily available public domain data and some proprietary data provided by terra-gen power, llc, (2) a re-interpretation of these data as required, (3) an exploratory geostatistical data analysis, (4) the baseline geothermal conceptual model, and (5) the EGS favorability/trust mapping.  The conceptual model presented applies to both the hydrothermal system and EGS in the Dixie Valley region. 

FSR Part II presents (1) 278 new gravity stations; (2) enhanced gravity-magnetic modeling; (3) 42 new ambient seismic noise survey stations; (4) an integration of the new seismic noise data with a regional seismic network; (5) a new methodology and approach to interpret this data; (5) a novel method to predict rock type and temperature based on the newly interpreted data; (6) 70 new magnetotelluric (MT) stations; (7) an integrated interpretation of the enhanced MT data set; (8) the results of a 308 station soil CO2 gas survey; (9) new conductive thermal modeling in the project area; (10) new convective modeling in the Calibration Area; (11) pseudo-convective modeling in the Calibration Area; (12) enhanced data implications and qualitative geoscience correlations at three scales (a) Regional, (b) Project, and (c) Calibration Area; (13) quantitative geostatistical exploratory data analysis; and (14) responses to nine questions posed in the proposal for this investigation.  

Enhanced favorability/trust maps were not generated because there was not a sufficient amount of new, fully-vetted (see below) rock type, temperature, and stress data. The enhanced seismic data did generate a new method to infer rock type and temperature (However, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator for this project, this new methodology needs to be tested and evaluated at other sites in the Basin and Range before it is used to generate the referenced maps. As in the baseline conceptual model, the enhanced findings can be applied to both the hydrothermal system and EGS in the Dixie Valley region).

 - Dataset: Newberry Well 55-29 Stimulation Data: The Newberry Volcano EGS Demonstration in central Oregon, a 3 year project started in 2010, tests recent technological advances designed to reduce the cost of power generated by EGS in a hot, dry well (NWG 55-29) drilled in 2008. First, the stimulation pumps used were designed to run for weeks and deliver large volumes of water at moderate well-head pressure. Second, to stimulate multiple zones, AltaRock developed thermo-degradable zonal isolation materials (TZIMs) to seal off fractures in a geothermal well to stimulate secondary and tertiary fracture zones. The TZIMs degrade within weeks, resulting in an optimized injection/ production profile of the entire well. Third, the project followed a project-specific Induced Seismicity Mitigation Plan (ISMP) to evaluate, monitor for, and mitigate felt induced seismicity. Stimulation started October 17, 2012 and continued for 7 weeks, with over 41,000 m3 of water injected. Two TZIM treatments successfully shifted the depth of stimulation. Injectivity, DTS, and seismic analysis indicate that fracture permeability in well NWG 55-29 was enhanced by two orders of magnitude.

This submission includes all of the files and reports associated with the geophysical exploration, stimulation, and monitoring included in the scope of the project.
 - Dataset: Alum Innovative Exploration Project (Ram Power Inc.): Data generated from the Alum Innovative Exploration Project, one of several promising geothermal properties located in the middle to upper Miocene (~11-5 Ma, or million years BP) Silver Peak-Lone Mountain metamorphic core complex (SPCC) of the Walker Lane structural belt in Esmeralda County, west-central Nevada. The geothermal system at Alum is wholly concealed; its upper reaches discovered in the late 1970s during a regional thermal-gradient drilling campaign. The prospect boasts several shallow thermal-gradient (TG) boreholes with TG >75oC/km (and as high as 440oC/km) over 200-m intervals in the depth range 0-600 m. Possibly boiling water encountered at 239 m depth in one of these boreholes returned chemical- geothermometry values in the range 150-230oC. GeothermEx (2008) has estimated the electrical- generation capacity of the current Alum leasehold at 33 megawatts for 20 years; and the corresponding value for the broader thermal anomaly extending beyond the property at 73 megawatts for the same duration.
 - Dataset: Silver Peak Innovative Exploration Project (Ram Power Inc.): Data generated from the Silver Peak Innovative Exploration Project, in Esmeralda County, Nevada, encompasses a deep-circulation (amagmatic) meteoric-geothermal system circulating beneath basin-fill sediments locally blanketed with travertine in western Clayton Valley (lithium-rich brines from which have been mined for several decades). Spring- and shallow-borehole thermal-water geochemistry and geothermometry suggest that a Silver Peak geothermal reservoir is very likely to attain the temperature range 260- 300oF (~125-150oC), and may reach 300-340oF (~150-170oC) or higher (GeothermEx, Inc., 2006). Results of detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis, and conceptual modeling of the prospect (1) support the GeothermEx (op. cit.) assertion that the Silver Peak prospect has good potential for geothermal-power production; and (2) provide a theoretical geologic framework for further exploration and development of the resource.

The Silver Peak prospect is situated in the transtensional (regional shearing coupled with extension) Walker Lane structural belt, and squarely within the late Miocene to Pliocene (11 Ma to ~5 Ma) Silver Peak-Lone Mountain metamorphic core complex (SPCC), a feature that accommodated initial displacement transfer between major right-lateral strike- slip fault zones on opposite sides of the Walker Lane. The SPCC consists essentially of a ductiley-deformed lower plate, or core, of Proterozoic metamorphic tectonites and tectonized Mesozoic granitoids separated by a regionally extensive, low-angle detachment fault from an upper plate of severely stretched and fractured structural slices of brittle, Proterozoic to Miocene-age lithologies. From a geothermal perspective, the detachment fault itself and some of the upper-plate structural sheets could function as important, if secondary, subhorizontal thermal-fluid aquifers in a Silver Peak hydrothermal system.
 - Dataset: New River Geothermal Exploration (Ram Power Inc.): The New River Geothermal Exploration (DOE Award No. EE0002843) is located approximately 25km south of the Salton Sea, near town of Brawley in Imperial County and approximately 150km east of San Diego, California.

A total of 182 MT Logger sites were completed covering the two separate Mesquite and New River grids. The data was collected over a frequency range of 320Hz to 0.001Hz with variable site spacing. A number of different inversion algorithms in 1D, 2D and 3D were used to produce resistivity-depth profiles and maps of subsurface resistivity variations over the survey area. For 2D inversions, a total of eighteen lines were constructed in east-west and north-south orientations crossing the entire survey area. For MT 3D inversion, the New River property was divided in two sub-grids, Mesquite and New River areas.

The report comprises of two parts. For the first part, inversions and geophysical interpretation results are presented with some recommendations of the potential targets for future follow up on the property. The second part of the report describes logistics of the survey, survey parameters, methodology and the survey results (data) in digital documents.

The report reviews a Spartan MT survey carried out by Quantec Geoscience Limited over the New River Project in California, USA on behalf of Ram Power Inc. Data was acquired over a period of 29 days from 2010/06/26 to 2010/07/24.
 - Dataset: Maine Geological Survey Borehole Temperature Profiles: This dataset includes temperature profiles from 30 boreholes throughout Maine that were selected for their depth, location, and lithologies encountered.  Depths range from about 300 feet to 2,200 feet.  Most of the boreholes selected for measurement were completed in granite because this lithology can be assumed to be nearly homogeneous over the depth of the borehole.  Boreholes were also selected to address gaps in existing geothermal datasets.  Temperature profiles were collected in October and November, 2012.

 - Dataset: Reservoir Stimulation Optimization with Operational Monitoring for Creation of EGS: EGS field projects have not sustained production at rates greater than half of what is needed for economic viability. The primary limitation that makes commercial EGS infeasible is our current inability to cost-effectively create high-permeability reservoirs from impermeable, igneous rock within the 3,000-10,000 ft depth range. 
Our goal is to develop a novel fracturing fluid technology that maximizes reservoir permeability while reducing stimulation cost and environmental impact. Laboratory equipment development to advance laboratory characterization/monitoring is also a priority of this project to study and optimize the physicochemical properties of these fracturing fluids in a range of reservoir conditions. Barrier G is the primarily intended GTO barrier to be addressed as well as support addressing barriers D, E and I.

 - Dataset: AASG Wells Data for the EGS Test Site Planning and Analysis Task: AASG Wells Data for the EGS Test Site Planning and Analysis Task
Temperature measurement data obtained from boreholes for the Association of American State Geologists (AASG) geothermal data project. Typically bottomhole temperatures are recorded from log headers, and this information is provided through a borehole temperature observation service for each state. Service includes header records, well logs, temperature measurements, and other information for each borehole. Information presented in Geothermal Prospector was derived from data aggregated from the borehole temperature observations for all states. For each observation, the given well location was recorded and the best available well identifier (name), temperature and depth were chosen. The "Well Name Source," "Temp. Type" and "Depth Type" attributes indicate the field used from the original service. This data was then cleaned and converted to consistent units. The accuracy of the observation's location, name, temperature or depth was note assessed beyond that originally provided by the service. 

-	AASG bottom hole temperature datasets were downloaded from repository.usgin.org between the dates of May 16th and May 24th, 2013.
-	Datasets were cleaned to remove null and non-real entries, and data converted into consistent units across all datasets
-	Methodology for selecting best temperature and depth attributes from column headers in AASG BHT Data sets:

Temperature:
	CorrectedTemperature - best
	MeasuredTemperature - next best

	DepthOfMeasurement - best
	TrueVerticalDepth - next best
	DrillerTotalDepth - last option
Well Name/Identifier:
	APINo - best
	WellName - next best
	ObservationURI - last option 

The column headers are as follows:
gid = internal unique ID
src_state = the state from which the well was downloaded (note: the low temperature wells in Idaho are coded as "ID_LowTemp", while all other wells are simply the two character state abbreviation)
source_url = the url for  the source WFS service or Excel file
temp_c = "best" temperature in Celsius
temp_type = indicates whether temp_c  comes from the corrected or measured temperature header column in the source document

name_src = indicates whether well_name came from apino, wellname, or observationuri header column in the source document
lat_wgs84 = latitude in wgs84
lon_wgs84 = longitude in wgs84
state = state in which the point is located
county = county in which the point is located
 - Dataset: Microearthquake Studies at the Salton Sea Geothermal Field: The objective of this project is to detect and locate microearthquakes to aid in the characterization of reservoir fracture networks. Accurate identification and mapping of the large numbers of microearthquakes induced in EGS is one technique that provides diagnostic information when determining the location, orientation and length of underground crack systems for use in reservoir development and management applications.  Conventional earthquake location techniques often are employed to locate microearthquakes.  However, these techniques require labor-intensive picking of individual seismic phase onsets across a network of sensors.  For this project we adapt the Matched Field Processing (MFP) technique to the elastic propagation problem in geothermal reservoirs to identify more and smaller events than traditional methods alone.
 - Dataset: Improved Microseismicity Detection During Newberry EGS Stimulations: Effective enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) require optimal fracture networks for efficient heat transfer between hot rock and fluid. Microseismic mapping is a key tool used to infer the subsurface fracture geometry. Traditional earthquake detection and location techniques are often employed to identify microearthquakes in geothermal regions. However, most commonly used algorithms may miss events if the seismic signal of an earthquake is small relative to the background noise level or if a microearthquake occurs within the coda of a larger event. Consequently, we have developed a set of algorithms that provide improved microearthquake detection. Our objective is to investigate the microseismicity at the DOE Newberry EGS site to better image the active regions of the underground fracture network during and immediately after the EGS stimulation.  Detection of more microearthquakes during EGS stimulations will allow for better seismic delineation of the active regions of the underground fracture system. This improved knowledge of the reservoir network will improve our understanding of subsurface conditions, and allow improvement of the stimulation strategy that will optimize heat extraction and maximize economic return.
 - Dataset: Exploration Case Studies on OpenEI: The goal of this project was to create a template (and associated form) on OpenEI to solicit crowd-sourced information sharing about various geothermal resource areas around the world.

 - Dataset: Chlorite Dissolution Rates From 25 to 275 degrees and pH 3 to 10: We have calculated a chlorite dissolution rate equation at far from equilibrium conditions by combining new data (20 experiments at high temperature) with previously published data Smith et al. 2013 and Lowson et al. 2007.  All rate data (from the 127 experiments) are tabulated in this data submission.  More information on the calculation of the rate data can be found in our FY13 Annual support (Carroll LLNL, 2013) which has been submitted to the GDR and is linked below.

The rate equation fills a data gap in geothermal kinetic data base and can be used directly to estimate the impact of chemical alteration on all geothermal processes.  It is especially important for understanding the role of chemical alteration in the weakening for shear zones in EGS systems.
 - Dataset: Life Cycle Water Consumption and Water Resource Assessment for Utility-Scale Geothermal Systems: An In-Depth Analysis of Historical and Forthcoming EGS Projects: This report is the third in a series of reports sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy Geothermal Technologies Program in which a range of water-related issues surrounding geothermal power production are evaluated. The first report made an initial attempt at quantifying the life cycle fresh water requirements of geothermal power-generating systems and explored operational and environmental concerns related to the geochemical composition of geothermal fluids. The initial analysis of life cycle fresh water consumption of geothermal power-generating systems identified that operational water requirements consumed the vast majority of water across the life cycle. However, it relied upon limited operational water consumption data and did not account for belowground operational losses for enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs). A second report presented an initial assessment of fresh water demand for future growth in utility-scale geothermal power generation. The current analysis builds upon this work to improve life cycle fresh water consumption estimates and incorporates regional water availability into the resource assessment to improve the identification of areas where future growth in geothermal electricity generation may encounter water challenges.

 - Dataset: Deep Sedimentary Basin EGS Development: Stratigraphic reservoirs with high permeability and temperature at economically accessible depths are attractive for power generation because of their large areal extent (> 100 km2) compared to the fault controlled hydrothermal reservoirs (< 10 km2) found throughout much of the western US. A preliminary screening of the geothermal power potential of sedimentary basins in the U.S. assuming present day drilling costs, a levelized cost of electricity over 30 years of $10/Wh, and realistic reservoir permeabilities, indicates that basins with heat flows of more than about 80 mW/m2, reservoir temperatures of more than 175 degrees C, and a reservoir depth of less than 4 km are required. This puts the focus for future geothermal power generation on high heat flow regions of California (e.g. the Imperial Valley and regions adjacent to The Geysers), the Rio Grande rift system of New Mexico and Colorado (especially the Denver Basin), the Great Basin of the western U.S., and high heat flow parts of Hawaii and the Alaska volcanic arc.

 - Dataset: Applications of Geothermally-Produced Colloidal Silica in Reservoir Management - Smart Gels: In enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) the reservoir permeability is often enhanced or created using hydraulic fracturing.  In hydraulic fracturing, high fluid pressures are applied to confined zones in the subsurface usually using packers to fracture the host rock.  This enhances rock permeability and therefore conductive heat transfer to the circulating geothermal fluid (e.g. water or supercritical carbon dioxide).  The ultimate goal is to increase or improve the thermal energy production from the subsurface by either optimal designs of injection and production wells or by altering the fracture permeability to create different zones of circulation that can be exploited in geothermal heat extraction.  Moreover, hydraulic fracturing can lead to the creation of undesirable short-circuits or fast flow-paths between the injection and extraction wells leading to a short thermal residence time, low heat recovery, and thus a short-life of the EGS. 

A potential remedy to these problems is to deploy a cementing (blocking, diverting) agent to minimize short-cuts and/or create new circulation cells for heat extraction.  A potential diverting agent is the colloidal silica by-product that can be co-produced from geothermal fluids.  Silica gels are abundant in various surface and subsurface applications, yet they have not been evaluated for EGS applications.  In this study we are investigating the benefits of silica gel deployment on thermal response of an EGS, either by blocking short-circuiting undesirable pathways as a result of diverting the geofluid to other fractures; or creating, within fractures, new circulation cells for harvesting heat through newly active surface area contact.  A significant advantage of colloidal silica is that it can be co-produced from geothermal fluids using an inexpensive membrane-based separation technology that was developed previously using DOE-GTP funding. 

This co-produced silica has properties that potentially make it useful as a fluid diversion agent for subsurface applications.  Colloidal silica solutions exist as low-viscosity fluids during their "induction period" but then undergo a rapid increase in viscosity (gelation) to form a solid gel.  The length of the induction period can be manipulated by varying the properties of the solution, such as silica concentration and colloid size.  We believe it is possible to produce colloidal silica gels suitable for use as diverting agents for blocking undesirable fast-paths which result in short-circuiting the EGS once hydraulic fracturing has been deployed.   In addition, the gels could be used in conventional geothermal fields to increase overall energy recovery by modifying flow.

 - Dataset: Life Cycle Analysis Data and Results for Geothermal and Other Electricity Generation Technologies: Life cycle analysis (LCA) is an environmental assessment method that quantifies the environmental performance of a product system over its entire lifetime, from cradle to grave. Based on a set of relevant metrics, the method is aptly suited for comparing the environmental performance of competing products systems. This file contains LCA data and results for electric power production including geothermal power. The LCA for electric power has been broken down into two life cycle stages, namely plant and fuel cycles.  

Relevant metrics include the energy ratio and greenhouse gas (GHG) ratios, where the former is the ratio of system input energy to total lifetime electrical energy out and the latter is the ratio of the sum of all incurred greenhouse gases (in CO2 equivalents) divided by the same energy output. 

Specific information included herein are material to power (MPR) ratios for a range of power technologies for conventional thermoelectric, renewables (including three geothermal power technologies), and coproduced natural gas/geothermal power. For the geothermal power scenarios, the MPRs include the casing, cement, diesel, and water requirements for drilling wells and topside piping.

Also included herein are energy and GHG ratios for plant and fuel cycle stages for the range of considered electricity generating technologies. 

Some of this information are MPR data extracted directly from the literature or from models (eg. ICARUS - a subset of ASPEN models) and others (energy and GHG ratios) are results calculated using GREET models and MPR data. MPR data for wells included herein were based on the Argonne well materials model and GETEM well count results.

 - Dataset: Active Management of Integrated Geothermal-CO2 Storage Reservoirs in Sedimentary Formations: Active Management of Integrated Geothermal-CO2 Storage Reservoirs in Sedimentary Formations: An Approach to Improve Energy Recovery and Mitigate Risk: FY1 Final Report
The purpose of phase 1 is to determine the feasibility of integrating geologic CO2 storage (GCS) with geothermal energy production. Phase 1 includes reservoir analyses to determine injector/producer well schemes that balance the generation of economically useful flow rates at the producers with the need to manage reservoir overpressure to reduce the risks associated with overpressure, such as induced seismicity and CO2 leakage to overlying aquifers. Based on a range of well schemes, techno-economic analyses of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) are conducted to determine the economic benefits of integrating GCS with geothermal energy production. In addition to considering CO2 injection, reservoir analyses are conducted for nitrogen (N2) injection to investigate the potential benefits of incorporating N2 injection with integrated geothermal-GCS, as well as the use of N2 injection as a potential pressure-support and working-fluid option. Phase 1 includes preliminary environmental risk assessments of integrated geothermal-GCS, with the focus on managing reservoir overpressure. Phase 1 also includes an economic survey of pipeline costs, which will be applied in Phase 2 to the analysis of CO2 conveyance costs for techno-economics analyses of integrated geothermal-GCS reservoir sites. Phase 1 also includes a geospatial GIS survey of potential integrated geothermal-GCS reservoir sites, which will be used in Phase 2 to conduct sweet-spot analyses that determine where promising geothermal resources are co-located in sedimentary settings conducive to safe CO2 storage, as well as being in adequate proximity to large stationary CO2 sources.

 - Dataset: McGee Mountain Shallow (2m) Temperature Survey, Humboldt County, Nevada 2009: This shapefile contains location and attribute data for a shallow (2 meter) temperature survey conducted by Geothermal Technical Partners, Inc. during late 2008 and early 2009. Temperatures at 2m depth were measured at 192 separate points as outlined by Coolbaugh et al., 2007. The purpose of the survey was to try and detect a shallow thermal anomaly associated with the McGee Mountain geothermal area as discovered by Phillips Petroleum and Earth Power Resources in the late 1970â€™s. Drilling identified ~120oC temperatures at ~100m depth. This 2-meter survey delineated what was interpreted as a steam-heated fault zone centered along a range front fault in the vicinity of the drilled holes and fumaroles.

 - Dataset: Modeling Responses of Naturally Fractured Geothermal Reservoir to Low-Pressure Stimulation: Hydraulic shearing is an appealing reservoir stimulation strategy for Enhanced Geothermal Systems. It is believed that hydro-shearing is likely to simulate a fracture network that covers a relatively large volume of the reservoir whereas hydro-fracturing tends to create a small number of fractures. In this paper, we examine the geomechanical and hydraulic behaviors of natural fracture systems subjected to hydro-shearing stimulation and develop a coupled numerical model within the framework of discrete fracture network modeling. We found that in the low pressure hydro-shearing regime, the coupling between the fluid phase and the rock solid phase is relatively simple, and the numerical model is computationally efficient. Using this modified model, we study the behavior of a random fracture network subjected to hydro-shearing stimulation.

 - Dataset: GEOTHERM Data Set: GEOTHERM is a comprehensive system of public databases and software used to store, locate, and evaluate information on the geology, geochemistry, and hydrology of geothermal systems. Three main databases address the general characteristics of geothermal wells and fields, and the chemical properties of geothermal fluids; the last database is currently the most active. System tasks are divided into four areas:

1. data acquisition and entry, involving data entry via word processors and magnetic tape;
2. quality assurance, including the criteria and standards handbook and front-end data-screening programs; 
3. operation, involving database backups and information extraction; and 
4. user assistance, preparation of such items as application programs, and a quarterly newsletter. 

The principal task of GEOTHERM is to provide information and research support for the conduct of national geothermal-resource assessments. The principal users of GEOTHERM are those involved with the Geothermal Research Program of the U.S. Geological Survey.
 - Dataset: Geothermal Exploration Cost and Time Metric: The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) was tasked with developing a metric in 2012 to measure the impacts of RD&D funding on the cost and time required for geothermal exploration activities. The development of this cost and time metric included collecting cost and time data for exploration techniques, creating a baseline suite of exploration techniques to which future exploration cost and time improvements can be compared, and developing an online tool for graphically showing potential project impacts (all available at http://en.openei.org/wiki/Gateway: Geothermal). 

This paper describes the methodology used to define the baseline exploration suite of techniques (baseline), as well as the approach that was used to create the cost and time data set that populates the baseline. The resulting product, an online tool for measuring impact, and the aggregated cost and time data are available on the Open Energy Information website (OpenEI, http://en.openei.org) for public access.
 - Dataset: Energy Return On Investment of Engineered Geothermal Systems Data: The project provides an updated Energy Return on Investment (EROI) for Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS).

EROI is a ratio of the energy delivered to the consumer to the energy consumed to build, operate, and decommission the facility.  EROI is important in assessing the viability of energy alternatives.  Currently EROI analyses of geothermal energy are either out-of-date, of uncertain methodology, or presented online with little supporting documentation.

This data set is a collection of files documenting data used to calculate the Energy Return On Investment (EROI) of Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) and erratum to publications prior to the final report.  Final report is available below, or from the OSTI web site (http://www.osti.gov/geothermal/).  Data in this collections includes the well designs used, input parameters for GETEM, a discussion of the energy needed to haul materials to the drill site, the baseline mud program, and a summary of the energy needed to drill each of the well designs.

EROI is the ratio of the energy delivered to the customer to the energy consumed to construct, operate, and decommission the facility.  Whereas efficiency is the ratio of the energy delivered to the customer to the energy extracted from the reservoir.  
 - Dataset: Auto Indexer Auto-Indexer for Percussive Hammers: Vane Motor Dynamometer Testing: Objectives
Options associated with geothermal drilling operations are generally limited by factors such as formation temperature and rock strength.  The objective of the research is to expand the "tool box" available to the geothermal driller by furthering the development of a high-temperature drilling motor that can be used in directional drilling applications for drilling high temperature geothermal formations.  The motor is specifically designed to operate in conjunction with a pneumatic down-the-hole-hammer.  It provides a more compact design compared to traditional drilling motors such as PDMs (positive displacement motors).  The packaging can help to enhance directional drilling capabilities.  It uses no elastomeric components, which enables it to operate in higher temperatures ( >250 degrees F). Current work on the motor has shown that is a capable of operating under pneumatic power with a down-the-hole-hammer.  Further development work will include continued testing and refining motor components and evaluating motor capabilities.

Impacts
The development of the motor will help to achieve program technical objectives by improving well construction capabilities.  This includes enabling high-temperature drilling as well as enhancing directional drilling.

A key component in the auto indexer is the drive motor.  It is an air-driven vane motor that converts the energy stored in the compressed air to mechanical energy.  The motor is attached to hammer-like components which impart an impulsive load onto the drive shaft.  The impulsive force on the drive shaft in turn creates an indexing action.

A controlled test was performed to characterize the performance of the the vane motor for a given pressure.  The Sandia dynamometer test station was used to determine the performance of the motor for a given input pressure.
 - Dataset: McGee Mountain Geoprobe Study, Humboldt County, Nevada: Geoprobes were developed by the environmental industry to collect water, gas and soil samples from contaminated sites at shallow depths (10-40 meters), with a minimum of environmental disturbance. A modified Geoprobe was used to collect bottom hole temperatures, and attempt to collect geothermal water samples, at the McGee Mountain geothermal property in Humboldt County, Nevada. A total of 23 holes were probed in five days for a cumulative total of 857.5 ft. at 21 sites at the project area. The probed holes ranged in depth from a maximum of 75ft to a minimum of 10ft and averaged 37.3ft. The average temperature of the 23 holes was 18.9 degrees C, corrected(from an average of 23.8 degrees C, uncorrected) with a range of 42.0 degrees C (site MMTG#19) for a maximum and 12.0 degrees C, corrected (site MMTG#1b). Since the water table was not encountered in any hole, no down-hole water samples were collected. However, water sampling was conducted at nearby springs and wells. PDF file, 15 MB file size.

 - Dataset: Chemical Impact of Elevated CO2 on Geothermal Energy Production: Numerical simulations have shown that the use of supercritical CO2 instead of water as a heat transfer fluid yields significantly greater heat extraction rates for geothermal energy. If this technology is implemented successfully, it could increase geothermal energy production and offset atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases. However, the impact of geochemical reactions between acidic waters in equilibrium with supercritical CO2 and the reservoir rock have not been evaluated. At issue are enhanced rock-water interactions that may reduce reservoir porosity and permeability and may exacerbate downstream scaling. 

The publications included in this submission aim to assess the geochemical impact of CO2 on geothermal energy production by analyzing the geochemistry of existing geothermal fields with elevated natural CO2, to measure realistic rock-water rates for geothermal systems using laboratory and field-based experiments, and to develop reactive transport models using the filed-based rates to simulate production scale impacts.
 - Dataset: Simulation Tools for Modeling Thermal Spallation Drilling on Multiple Scales: Widespread adoption of geothermal energy will require access to deeply buried resources in granitic basement rocks at high temperatures and pressures. Exploiting these resources necessitates novel methods for drilling, stimulation, and maintenance, under operating conditions that are often difficult or impossible to reproduce in laboratory settings. Physically rigorous numerical modeling tools are vital to highlight potential risks, guide process optimization and reduce the uncertainties involved in developing new technologies for these environments. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed, and is constantly improving, several multi-physics solid/structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, chemistry, and discrete element codes. Integration of the LLNL simulation tools into a coherent simulation environment will provide a predictive capability for the thermomechanical response - in particular the spall and fracture - of basement rocks at high temperatures and pressures useful for drilling and other geothermal applications. This paper outlines a modeling effort investigating the processes involved in hydrothermal spallation drilling. These include interconnected phenomena on several length and time scales: from system-scale fluid dynamics and heat transfer of the high temperature jet to the rock face to the grain-scale thermomechanics of spallation. Three models are described to capture these different scale processes: a grain-scale model to investigate the onset of spallation; a particulate fluids model to simulate the transport of the produced spalls; and a borehole-scale model to represent the integrated system behavior.
 - Dataset: Geomechanical Modeling for Thermal Spallation Drilling: Wells for Engineered Geothermal Systems (EGS) typically occur in conditions presenting significant challenges for conventional rotary and percussive drilling technologies: granitic rocks that reduce drilling speeds and cause substantial equipment wear. Thermal spallation drilling, in which rock is fragmented by high temperature rather than mechanical means, offers a potential solution to these problems. However, much of the knowledge surrounding this drilling technique is empirical - based on laboratory experiments that may or may not represent field conditions. This paper outlines a new numerical modeling effort investigating the grain-scale processes governing thermal spallation drilling. Several factors affect spall production at the mesoscale, including grain size and size distribution, surface temperatures and material heterogeneity. To investigate the relative influence of these factors, we have conducted a series of simulations using GEODYN - a parallel Eulerian solid and fluid dynamics code. In this paper, we describe a two-dimensional model used to simulate the grain-scale processes and present preliminary results from this modeling effort.
 - Dataset: Grain-Scale Failure in Thermal Spallation Drilling: Geothermal power promises clean, renewable, reliable and potentially widely-available energy, but is limited by high initial capital costs. New drilling technologies are required to make geothermal power financially competitive with other energy sources. One potential solution is offered by Thermal Spallation Drilling (TSD) - a novel drilling technique in which small particles (spalls) are released from the rock surface by rapid heating. In this paper, we discuss results from a new modeling effort investigating thermal spallation drilling. In particular, we describe an explicit model that simulates the grain-scale mechanics of thermal spallation and use this model to examine existing theories concerning spalling mechanisms. We will report how borehole conditions influence spall production, and discuss implications for macro-scale models of drilling systems.
 - Dataset: Generalized Displacement Correlation Method for Estimating Stress Intensity Factors: This paper presents a generalized form of the displacement correlation method (the GDC method), which can use any linear or quadratic finite element type with homogeneous meshing without local refinement. These two features are critical for modeling dynamic fracture propagation problems where locations of fractures are not known a priori. Because regular finite elements' shape functions do not include the square-root terms, which are required for accurately representing the near-tip displacement field, the GDC method is enriched via a correction multiplier term. This paper develops the formulation of the GDC method and includes a number of numerical examples, especially those consisting of multiple interacting fractures. An alternative formulation using linear elements is also demonstrated to be accurate for mode-I fracturing, and acceptable mode-II results for most engineering applications can be obtained with appropriate mesh refinement, which remains considerably less than that required by most other methods for estimating stress intensities.
 - Dataset: Investigation of Stimulation-Response Relationships for Complex Fracture Systems in Enhanced Geothermal Reservoirs: Hydraulic fracturing is currently the primary method for stimulating low-permeability geothermal reservoirs and creating Enhanced (or Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS) with improved permeability and heat production efficiency.  Complex natural fracture systems usually exist in the formations to be stimulated and it is therefore critical to understand the interactions between existing fractures and newly created fractures before optimal stimulation strategies can be developed.  Our study aims to improve the understanding of EGS stimulation-response relationships by developing and applying computer-based models that can effectively reflect the key mechanisms governing interactions between complex existing fracture networks and newly created hydraulic fractures.  In this paper, we first briefly describe the key modules of our methodology, namely a geomechanics solver, a discrete fracture flow solver, a rock joint response model, an adaptive remeshing module, and most importantly their effective coupling.  After verifying the numerical model against classical closed-form solutions, we investigate responses of reservoirs with different preexisting natural fractures to a variety of stimulation strategies.  The factors investigated include: the in situ stress states (orientation of the principal stresses and the degree of stress anisotropy), pumping pressure, and stimulation sequences of multiple wells.

 - Dataset: Using Fully Coupled Hydro-Geomechanical Numerical Test Bed to Study Reservoir Stimulation with Low Hydraulic Pressure: This paper documents our effort to use a fully coupled hydro-geomechanical numerical test bed to study using low hydraulic pressure to stimulate geothermal reservoirs with existing fracture network. In this low pressure stimulation strategy, fluid pressure is lower than the minimum in situ compressive stress, so the fractures are not completely open but permeability improvement can be achieved through shear dilation. We found that in this low pressure regime, the coupling between the fluid phase and the rock solid phase becomes very simple, and the numerical model can achieve a low computational cost. Using this modified model, we study the behavior of a single fracture and a random fracture network.

 - Dataset: Simulating Complex Fracture Systems in Geothermal Reservoirs Using an Explicitly Coupled Hydro-Geomechanical Model: Low permeability geothermal reservoirs can be stimulated by hydraulic fracturing to create Enhanced (or Engineered) Geothermal Systems (EGS) with higher permeability and improved heat transfer to increase heat production. In this paper, we document our effort to develop a numerical simulator with explicit geomechanics-discrete flow network coupling by utilizing and further advancing the simulation capabilities of the Livermore Distinct Element Code (LDEC). The important modules of the simulator include an explicit finite element solid solver, a finite volume method flow solver, a joint model using the combined FEM-DEM capability of LDEC, and an adaptive remeshing module. The numerical implementation is verified against the classical KGD model. The interaction between two fractures with simple geometry and the stimulation of a relatively complex existing fracture network under different in-situ stress conditions are studied with the simulator.
 - Dataset: Fully Coupled Geomechanics and Discrete Flow Network Modeling of Hydraulic Fracturing for Geothermal Applications: The primary objective of our current research is to develop a computational test bed for evaluating borehole techniques to enhance fluid flow and heat transfer in enhanced geothermal systems (EGS).

This paper details the basic methodology of our approach. Two numerical examples showing the capability and effectiveness of our simulator are also presented.

### Project: Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2
The Wind Forecast Improvement Project in Complex Terrain, or **WFIP2**, field campaign officially ended on March 31, 2017. However, some instruments continued to collect data in the field after this date. In general, the data collected after March 31, 2017 have not been quality controlled (QC) and exist on the DAP as **z0** data. These data should only be used after discussions with the instrument owners. If any of these data have undergone QC, they will exist as **b0** data.

The WFIP2 has maintained two overarching scientific goals:

  1.	To improve the physical understanding of atmospheric processes that directly affect wind energy forecasts in areas of complex terrain.  
  2.	To incorporate the new understanding into a foundational weather forecasting model that improves wind energy forecasts.  


[Read more ...](https://a2e.energy.gov/projects/wfip2)

### Dataset Overview
The primary purpose of WFIP2 Model Development Team is to improve existing numerical weather prediction models in a manner that leads to improved wind forecasts in regions of complex terrain. Improvements in the models will come through better understanding of the physics associated with the wind flow in and around the wind plant across a range of temporal and spatial scales, which will be gained through WFIP2’s observational field study and analysis.

### Dataset Overview
The primary purpose of WFIP2 Model Development Team is to improve existing numerical weather prediction models in a manner that leads to improved wind forecasts in regions of complex terrain. Improvements in the models will come through better understanding of the physics associated with the wind flow in and around the wind plant across a range of temporal and spatial scales, which will be gained through WFIP2’s observational field study and analysis.

### Project: Wake Steering Experiment
Planned for May through September 2016, Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will execute a joint experimental campaign examining wind farm control at the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) facility, hosted at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. The experimental campaign will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, an Offset Controller (OC) will be applied to the upwind wind turbine. This controller applies an offset to a nacelle-based wind direction sensor used for aligning the turbine to the wind direction to achieve a prescribed misalignment to the wind. In Phase II, the controller will be replaced by a Wake Steering Controller (WSC) that uses a look-up table based on the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model to find offsets that produce a desired amount of wake steering. The data collected during both phases will be used to perform initial verification and validation studies on controls-oriented models, such as FLORIS, as well as higher-fidelity wind plant analysis models, such as Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA). Target data include inflow, wake, and turbine performance and loads.

### Project: Leading-edge Erosion Study (LEES) Project
#### Airfoil Performance Degradation due to Roughness and Leading-edge Erosion

Wind farms often underperform predicted power output by 10 to 30 percent relative to manufacturer predictions. A potential aerodynamic explanation is that blade roughness caused by insect impingement and leading-edge erosion decreases lift and drag as opposed to “clean” blades. These effects are difficult to test in the field because aerodynamic performance cannot be measured directly and can be affected by many factors that cannot be controlled in field experiments. This project provides aerodynamic performance data using wind tunnel measurements of representative inboard and outboard blade sections contaminated with various types and levels of roughness and leading-edge erosion. Results include aerodynamic load coefficients and measurements of laminar-to-turbulent transition location as functions of Reynolds number and angle of attack for various roughness configurations.

### Project: Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2
The Wind Forecast Improvement Project in Complex Terrain, or **WFIP2**, field campaign officially ended on March 31, 2017. However, some instruments continued to collect data in the field after this date. In general, the data collected after March 31, 2017 have not been quality controlled (QC) and exist on the DAP as **z0** data. These data should only be used after discussions with the instrument owners. If any of these data have undergone QC, they will exist as **b0** data.

The WFIP2 has maintained two overarching scientific goals:

  1.	To improve the physical understanding of atmospheric processes that directly affect wind energy forecasts in areas of complex terrain.  
  2.	To incorporate the new understanding into a foundational weather forecasting model that improves wind energy forecasts.

However, some instruments continued to collect data in the field after this date. In general, the data collected after March 31, 2017 have not been quality controlled (QC) and exist on the DAP as **z0** data. These data should only be used after discussions with the instrument owners. If any of these data have undergone QC, they will exist as **b0** data.

The WFIP2 has maintained two overarching scientific goals:

  1.	To improve the physical understanding of atmospheric processes that directly affect wind energy forecasts in areas of complex terrain.  
  2.	To incorporate the new understanding into a foundational weather forecasting model that improves wind energy forecasts.

### Project: Wake Steering Experiment
Planned for May through September 2016, Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory will execute a joint experimental campaign examining wind farm control at the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) facility, hosted at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas. The experimental campaign will be conducted in two phases. In Phase I, an Offset Controller (OC) will be applied to the upwind wind turbine. This controller applies an offset to a nacelle-based wind direction sensor used for aligning the turbine to the wind direction to achieve a prescribed misalignment to the wind. In Phase II, the controller will be replaced by a Wake Steering Controller (WSC) that uses a look-up table based on the FLOw Redirection and Induction in Steady-state (FLORIS) model to find offsets that produce a desired amount of wake steering. The data collected during both phases will be used to perform initial verification and validation studies on controls-oriented models, such as FLORIS, as well as higher-fidelity wind plant analysis models, such as Simulator fOr Wind Farm Applications (SOWFA). Target data include inflow, wake, and turbine performance and loads.

### Project: Wind Forecast Improvement Project 2
The Wind Forecast Improvement Project in Complex Terrain, or **WFIP2**, field campaign officially ended on March 31, 2017. However, some instruments continued to collect data in the field after this date. In general, the data collected after March 31, 2017 have not been quality controlled (QC) and exist on the DAP as **z0** data. These data should only be used after discussions with the instrument owners. If any of these data have undergone QC, they will exist as **b0** data.

The WFIP2 has maintained two overarching scientific goals:

  1.	To improve the physical understanding of atmospheric processes that directly affect wind energy forecasts in areas of complex terrain.  
  2.	To incorporate the new understanding into a foundational weather forecasting model that improves wind energy forecasts.

 - Dataset: SWERA: The SWERA Programme was a collaboration of worldwide partners with a mission to provide information on renewable energy resources for countries and regions around the world. Funding and support for the SWERA Programme concluded in 2011, at which time all programme data and information were transferred to OpenEI for long-term availability.

The programme partners, which included the U.S. Department of Energy and NREL, are no longer supporting or maintaining the data.  OpenEI has archived the data and is making it publicly available for historical purposes.  While the data may be useful for historical reference, it is suggested that users interested in global renewable resource data consult more recent resources.

 - Dataset: SmartGrid.gov Quarterly Data Summaries: This dataset represents a historical repository of all the numerical data from the smartgrid.gov website condensed into spreadsheets to enable analysis of the data.  Below are a couple of things worth noting:

* The data visible on the smartgrid.gov website is dynamic.  As new data is submitted by the utilities, it is validated, and then gets published to the website.  So the smartgrid.gov website always contains the most current data.
* The attached spreadsheets are a quarterly, static "snapshots" of the data from the smartgrid.gov website.  So if there is a discrepancy between values in this dataset and the smartgrid.gov website; the website numbers always represent the most current data.
* The cost data in this dataset is the summation of project and cost share values reported by the utilities.  (In other words, the cost data is the sum of federal dollars spent plus cost share dollars spent by the recipient utility.)
* Some of the values visible on the website are aggregations of the values in the quarterly data summary spreadsheets.

It consists of hourly load data in CSV format for use with the PNNL taxonomy of distribution feeders [2].  These feeders were developed in the open source GridLAB-D modelling language [3].  In this dataset each of the load points in the taxonomy feeders is populated with hourly averaged load data from a utility in the feeder’s geographical region, scaled and randomized to emulate real load profiles.  For more information on the scaling and randomization process, see [1]. 

The taxonomy feeders are statistically representative of the various types of distribution feeders found in five geographical regions of the U.S.  Efforts are underway (possibly complete) to translate these feeders into the OpenDSS modelling language. 

This data set consists of one large CSV file for each feeder.  Within each CSV, each column represents one load bus on the feeder.  The header row lists the name of the load bus.  The subsequent 8760 rows represent the loads for each hour of the year.  The loads were scaled and randomized using a Python script, so each load series represents only one of many possible randomizations.  In the header row, "rl" = residential load and "cl" = commercial load.  Commercial loads are followed by a phase letter (A, B, or C).  For regions 1-3, the data is from 2009.  For regions 4-5, the data is from 2000.

For use in GridLAB-D, each column will need to be separated into its own CSV file without a header.  The load value goes in the second column, and corresponding datetime values go in the first column, as shown in the sample file, sample_individual_load_file.csv.  Only the first value in the time column needs to written as an absolute time; subsequent times may be written in relative format (i.e. "+1h", as in the sample).  The load should be written in P+Qj format, as seen in the sample CSV, in units of Watts (W) and Volt-amps reactive (VAr).  This dataset was derived from metered load data and hence includes only real power; reactive power can be generated by assuming an appropriate power factor.  These loads were used with GridLAB-D version 2.2.

 - Dataset: Import Shipments of Solar Thermal Collectors by Country, 2008 and 2009: Solar thermal devices use direct heat from the sun, concentrating it in 
some manner to produce heat at useful temperatures. The modern solar 
industry began with the oil embargo of 1973-1974 and was strengthened 
with the second embargo in 1979. The growth of the solar industry during
 this period of fuel shortages and high prices (1974-1984) soared from 
45 solar collector manufacturing firms to 225 firms. The solar market 
was helped during this period by government assistance, both Federal and
 State. Currently, solar thermal devices do everything from heating 
swimming pools to creating steam for electricity generation. Data published by the <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/U.S._Energy_Information_Administration" title="" target="_blank">U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).</a>

 - Dataset: Weatherization Assistance Program: The U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) was created in 1976 to assist low-income families who lacked resources to invest in energy efficiency. WAP is operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Native American tribes, and U.S. Territories. The energy conservation resulting from the efforts of state and local agencies helps our country reduce its dependence on foreign oil and decrease the cost of energy for families in need while improving the health and safety of their homes.

This dataset contains a link to the WAPTAC website, which contains a ‘virtual’ library of all rules, regulations, policies and procedures required by DOE's weatherization program. The site is a central repository for presentation materials, photos and videos of work in progress, site demonstrations, news articles, and other documentation to support WAP operations. WAPTAC.org serves as the institutional memory of the Program.
 - Dataset: NREL Wave Energy Assessment for the United States and Puerto Rico: This dataset estimates the naturally available and technically recoverable U.S. wave energy resources, using a 51-month Wavewatch III hindcast database developed especially for this study by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) National Centers for Environmental Prediction.  For total resource estimation, wave power density in terms of kilowatts per meter is aggregated across a unit diameter circle.  This approach is fully consistent with accepted global practice and includes the resource made available by the lateral transfer of wave energy along wave crests, which enables densities within a few kilometers of a linear array, even for fixed terminator devices.

EPRI is the prime contractor, Virginia Tech is responsible for development of the models and estimating the wave resource, and NREL serves as an independent validator and also develops the final GIS-based display of the data.

###Geographic Range###
US coastline, including AK, HI and Puerto Rico, out to 50 nautical miles.

###Grid Properties###
Grids are derived from WaveWatch III grids. Near the coast of the lower 48 and HI, grids are squares, 4 minutes by 4 minutes (15 per degree).
For the Alaska grids AK and BS, the grid is 4 minutes of latitude by 8 minutes of longitude (15 per deg by 7.5 per deg).

*Exception*: The area in the Bering Sea around the Pribilof (St Paul and St George) Islands is 10 min lat by 15 min lon. Limits: 55.666 to 58.000 N, -172.000 to - 168.000 E, 17 cols, 15 rows.

Farther offshore, the grid is 10 min by 10 min. (only seen in WM and PR)

The 10 min by 10 min grid appears near the edge of a few grids: 

* SW corner of WM (off Mexican coast) 
* SE corner of WM (deep water) 
* PR - around edges (far from PR and US territory)

###Bathymetric Impacts on Resource Assessment###
Bathymetric effects are known to have a large effect on wave characteristics at depths shallower than approximately 20m (~65 ft) on the Atlantic coast and 50 m (~160 ft) on the Pacific coast. A variance between depths exists due to the feature differences for each continental shelf.  The methodology used in this resource assessment precludes providing site-specific information to such developers. Reliable site-specific information in shallow waters can only be produced using results from models with higher spatial resolution that include shallow-water physics. The wave resource assessment group acknowledges that its results will not be accurate in the shallower waters of the inner continental shelf.  These shallow water regions are located within the dark gray boundaries on the map.

Data that are undefined or unrepresentable are indicated by NaN values in the CSV and as a -9999 value in the shapefile tables.

 - Dataset: EERE Energy Analysis Data and Tools: On this website, energy analysts and policymakers can access energy analysis products, including published analyses, energy data and maps, and analysis tools from EERE and the broader DOE-supported energy analysis community. While the website provides links to important energy analysis products, it is not a comprehensive source of such products.
 - Dataset: SunShot Catalyst Datasets and Resources: SunShot Catalyst program centers on reducing the time-to-market of compelling solar market solutions. Given that the U.S. market economy is highly competitive, one of the best proven strategies for sustainable success against competition is faster and better innovation. This program enables entrepreneur innovation and crowd-sourced application development.

This resource provides various datasets and website links created to enable participation in the program and easy registration to the U.S. Department of Energy SunShot Initiative Catalyst Prize Challenge.  It includes the Catalyst website link, relevant hackpad links, important videos and information about key datasets and tools, and a listing of the Catalyst teams with descriptions.
 - Dataset: United States Incentives Database Snapshots and Feeds: Good news for developers who want to use incentive and policy data in their apps!  This dataset now has a current & historical archive of XML files that started archiving every day from August 28th, 2012.  The OpenEI XML repository of incentives and policy data includes data from DSIREUSA.org, due to North Carolina State University's contract to put incentive and policy data directly into OpenEI. 
 - Dataset: Transient Cold-Climate Building Foundation Hygrothermal Experimental Data: The data consist of two years of continuous transient experimental measurements on the hygrothermal performance of concrete masonry block walls in a full basement in a cold climate (US DOE climate zone 7). The walls were insulated in compliance with the thermal requirements of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code and in compliance with the durability performance requirements of the 2009 MN Building Code. These data are useful for verifying the physical validity of cold-climate foundation insulation system building code requirements; understanding the physics of heat and moisture transport in foundation walls from an experimental perspective; and, validating the predictions of thermal and hygrothermal building foundation simulation programs. The data are in the public domain and can be released now since the peer-review process has been completed.
 - Dataset: Residential Energy Consumption Survey Results: Total Energy Consumption, Expenditures, and Intensities (2005): The Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) is a national survey that collects residential energy-related data. The 2005 survey collected data from 4,381 households in housing units statistically selected to represent the 111.1 million housing units in the U.S. Data were obtained from residential energy suppliers for each unit in the sample to produce the Consumption & Expenditures data. The Consumption & Expenditures and Intensities data is divided into two parts: Part 1 provides energy consumption and expenditures by census region, population density, climate zone, type of housing unit, year of construction and ownership status; Part 2 provides the same data according to household size, income category, race and age. The next update to the RECS survey (2009 data) will be available in 2011.
 - Dataset: EDX: ###What is the Energy Data eXchange?

The Energy Data eXchange (EDX) was developed and is maintained by NETL-ORD 
as an online system to support internal coordination and collaboration 
as well as timely tech transfer of data-driven products across NETL's 
research portfolios, see "[about NETL](http://netl.doe.gov/about)" for more information. 

 EDX coordinates historical and current data and information from a wide
 variety of sources to facilitate access to research that crosscuts 
multiple NETL projects/programs.

EDX provides external access to technical products and data published by NETL-affiliated research teams.

 NETL-affiliated researchers can use EDX's Collaborative Workspaces to 
coordinate and share work with a variety of organizations and 
institutions in a secure environment.

* * *
###Why was EDX created? 

 NETL recognized a need to improve coordination and reliable access to 
information and research products for our own research teams and amongst
 our collaborators, as well as improve dissemination (tech transfer) of 
research-driven products. By improving the efficiency of data access and
 data sharing, EDX facilitates a more rapid and comprehensive 
utilization of key data needs that crosscut multiple projects/program 
areas (CO2 storage, unconventional and conventional 
hydrocarbon systems, natural gas hydrates, etc.). In addition, EDX 
provides a cross-cutting system to ensure lasting access to research 
data and products for future use by NETL and our partners.

* * *
###Who uses EDX? 
 Primary users of EDX are NETL (NETL-affiliated research teams, both 
in-house and program-related) and non-NETL Fossil Energy researchers 
actively engaged in work relevant to a broad spectrum of energy and 
environmental research and development programs. EDX provides this 
access to evaluate and predict what happens in engineered and natural 
systems, while helping accelerate further research.
 - Dataset: Land use requirements for ground-mounted solar power facilities.: This dataset is part of a larger internal dataset at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) that explores various characteristics of large solar electric (both PV and CSP) facilities around the United States. This dataset focuses on the land use characteristics for solar facilities that are either under construction or currently in operation.
 - Dataset: Commercial and Residential Hourly Load Profiles for all TMY3 Locations in the United States: This dataset contains hourly load profile data for 16 commercial building types (based off the [DOE commercial reference building models](http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings)) and residential buildings (based off the [Building America House Simulation Protocols](http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/49246.pdf)). This dataset also uses the [Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS)](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/) for statistical references of building types by location. Hourly load profiles are available for over all TMY3 locations in the United States [here](http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/old_data/nsrdb/1991-2005/tmy3/).

[Browse files](http://en.openei.org/datasets/files/961/pub/) in this dataset, accessible as individual files and as commercial and residential downloadable ZIP files.  This dataset is approximately 4.8GiB compressed or 19GiB uncompressed.

July 2nd, 2013 update: Residential High and Low load files have been updated from 366 days in a year for leap years to the more general 365 days in a normal year.
 - Dataset: DOE Buildings Performance Database, sample Residential data: * This is a non-proprietary subset of DOE's Buildings Performance Database. Buildings from the cities of Dayton, OH and Gainesville, FL areas are provided as an example of the data in full database.
* Sample data here is formatted as CSV
* The Buildings Performance Database will have an API that allows access to the statistics about the data without exposing private information about individual buildings.
* The data available in this sample is limited due to the nature of the original datasets; the Buildings Performance database combines data from multiple sources to improve overall robustness.
* Data fields stored in the database can be seen in the BPD taxonomy: http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/buildingsperformance/taxonomy.html
 - Dataset: NREL Geothermal GIS Data: This dataset is a qualitative assessment of geothermal potential for the U.S. using Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) and based on the levelized cost of electricity with CLASS 1 being most favorable and CLASS 5 being least favorable. This dataset does not include shallow EGS resources located near hydrothermal sites or the U.S. Geological Survey assessment of undiscovered hydrothermal resources. The source data for deep EGS includes temperature at depth from 3 to 10 kilometer (km) were provided by the Southern Methodist University Geothermal Laboratory (Blackwell & Richards, 2009) and the analyses for regions with temperatures ≥150°C were performed by NREL (2009). CLASS 999 regions have temperatures less than 150°C at a 10-km depth and were not assessed for deep EGS potential. Temperature at depth data for deep EGS in Alaska and Hawaii are not currently available.
 - Dataset: Solar Resources by Class and Country: These estimates are derived from the best available solar resource data available to NREL.  Resources are organized by class and country.  Resolution varies spatially from 1 km to 1 degree (approximately 100 km) depending on the data source.  High spatial resolution datasets (1 km to 40 km cells) were modeled to support country or regional projects.  Where high resolution datasets were not available, data from NASA’s Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) version 6 database were used.  

The data represent total potential solar energy per year as a function of land area per solar class (`KWh/m²/day`).  Each solar class correlates to a specific `0.5 kWh/m²/day` range.  Energy is calculated by multiplying the productive land by the class, conversion efficiency and number of days per year.  In this case, a standard calendar year of 365 days was used.  The conversion efficiency rate applied was 10%.

`E = Productive Land * kWh/m²/day * 365 days * 10% efficiency`

The solar data has been derived from solar data measured or modeled between 1961  and 2008, depending on the dataset.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Cold Water Depth (Summer Average): This shapefile represents seasonal summer average cold water depth recordings.

The cold water is defined by locating the depth that leads to the greatest average annual net power at each location when depth and its corresponding ΔT are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe. Input depth and temperature values are obtained from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and are reported at discrete depth levels. The cut-off for maximum cold water depth is 1000 m.

Data were processed and converted to shapefile format by NREL for the [Ocean Thermal Extractable Energy Visualization](http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/1055457/1055457.pdf)

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - delta T (Winter Average): This shapefile represents seasonal winter average delta T estimates.
<br><br>
ΔT represents the difference in temperature (°C) between the warm and cold water sources used by an OTEC plant at a specific location. Warm water is defined uniformly as water at a depth of 20 m, while cold water is defined for each point by locating the depth that leads to the greatest annual net power when each depth and ΔT along the thermocline are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe.

 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Continental United States Photovoltaic Low Resolution: _Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for the lower 48 states of the United States of America.

_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for the United States of America lower 48 states. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.

_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. 
Units are in kilowatt hours per meter squared per day.

 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Hawaii Direct Normal Solar Resource 10km Resolution (1998 - 2005): This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model. This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. A modified Bird model is used to calculate clear sky direct normal (DNI). This is then adjusted as a function of the ratio of clear sky global horizontal (GHI) and the model predicted GHI. Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meteorological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not available at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.

As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 15% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other microclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.

 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: United States Hydrogen Potential From Renewable Resources: Estimate the potential for producing hydrogen from key renewable resources (onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and biomass) by county for the United States. This study was conducted to estimate the potential for producing hydrogen from key renewable resources (onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, and biomass) by county in the United States and to create maps that allow the reader to easily visualize the results. To accomplish this objective, the authors analyzed renewable resource data both statistically and graphically utilizing a state-of-the-art Geographic Information System (GIS), a computer-based information system used to create and visualize geographic information.

Land-use and environmental exclusions were applied to represent the most viable resources across the country. While wind, solar, and biomass are considered major renewable resources, other renewable energy resources could also be used for hydrogen production, thus contributing to hydrogen development locally and regionally. These additional resources include offshore wind, concentrating solar power, geothermal, hydropower, photoelectrochemical, and photobiological resources.

This study found that approximately 1 billion metric tons of hydrogen could be produced annually from wind, solar, and biomass resources in the United States. The greatest potential for producing hydrogen from these key renewable resources is in the Great Plains region. In addition, this research suggests that renewable hydrogen has the potential to displace gasoline consumption in most states if and when a number of technical and scientific barriers can be overcome.

 - Dataset: Kentucky High Resolution Wind Resource: Annual average wind resource potential for the state of Kentucky at a 50 meter height.

This data set has been validated by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants. However, the data is not suitable for micro-siting potential development projects. This shapefile was generated from a raster dataset with a 200 m resolution, in a UTM zone 12, datum WGS 84 projection system.

The wind power resource estimates were produced by TrueWind Solutions using their MesoMap system and historical weather data under contract to Wind Powering America/NREL. This map has been validated with available surface data by NREL and wind energy meteorological consultants.
 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Hawaii Photovoltaic (Tilt = Latitude) 10km Resolution (1998 - 2005): This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of 0.1 degrees in both latitude and longitude, or about 10 km in size. This data was developed using the State University of New York/Albany satellite radiation model.  This model was developed by Dr. Richard Perez and collaborators at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and other universities for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Perez, et al. (2002). This model uses hourly radiance images from geostationary weather satellites, daily snow cover data, and monthly averages of atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the hourly total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalable at a 10km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) | Seawater Cooling - Depth Profile 14ºC (Winter Average): This shapefile represents the seasonal winter depth profile to reach water at a temperature of 14ºC.

Sea water cooling can be used for industrial or residential cooling needs where heat must be rejected. A typical resource for direct air-conditioning applications is no warmer than 8ºC, which has been established as a minimum value of interest for this study. Water at temperatures between 8ºC and 20ºC can be used to supplement air conditioning processes, or to reject heat from many other low temperature industrial processes. Water temperatures above 20ºC were not considered for this investigation as cost savings begin to break down as sea water temperature nears ambient temperatures. Depth profiles for three water temperatures of interest: 8ºC, 14ºC and 20ºC were established to aid selection of optimal sites for sea water cooling. A cool shallow resource just off the coast where a need may exist presents significant opportunity for energy and cost savings.

 - Dataset: Detailed Renewable Energy Resource Assessment Data Inventory (US): Detailed inventory of available renewable energy (RE) resource assessment data. Although the type, amount, and regional distribution of resource information vary by resource, assessments are available for each RE category (conducted by <a href="http://en.openei.org/wiki/DOE" title="DOE page in OpenEI" target="_blank">DOE</a> and various private and public organizations). Solar, wind and geothermal resources have assessment products available at numerous scales (national, regional, and site specific). Assessments are available for biomass and hydropower resources at a national level, with only limited information available at the regional and site-specific levels. Ocean energy has the least resource assessment information available. This information was compiled by NREL and initially published in the 2006 <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111017133847/https://apps3.eere.energy.gov/ba/pba/analysis_database/docs/pdf/fy06_epact_201_report.pdf" title="2006 Report to Congress" target="_blank">Report to Congress on Renewable Energy Resource Assessment Information for the United States</a> (Original document courtesy of archive.org). This datasets was last updated in January, 2011. For each assessment, the inventory includes: data name, data type, source, period of record, spatial coverage, spatial resolution, temporal scale, units, stated accuracy, availability, URL, update frequency, and additional notes.
 - Dataset: Commercial Building Profiles: <div>
 This dataset includes simulation results from a national-scale study of the commercial buildings sector.  Electric load profiles contain the hour-by-hour demand for electricity for each building. Summary tables describe individual buildings and their overall annual energy performance.  The study developed detailed EnergyPlus models for 4,820 different samples in 2003 CBECS.  Simulation output is available for all and organized by CBECS’s identification number in public use datasets.  Three modeling scenarios are available: existing stock (with 2003 historical weather), stock as if rebuilt new (with typical weather), and the stock if rebuilt using maximum efficiency technology (with typical weather).

 - Dataset: Building Component Library: The Building Component Library (BCL) is the U.S. Department of Energy’s comprehensive online searchable library of energy modeling building blocks and descriptive metadata. Novice users and seasoned practitioners can use the freely available and uniquely identifiable components to create energy models and cite the sources of input data, which will increase the credibility and reproducibility of their simulations.    The BCL contains components which are the building blocks of an energy model. They can represent physical characteristics of the building such as roofs, walls, and windows, or can refer to related operational information such as occupancy and equipment schedules and weather information. Each component is identified through a set of attributes that are specific to its type, as well as other metadata such as provenance information and associated files.    The BCL also contains energy conservation measures (ECM), referred to as measures, which describe a change to a building and its associated model. For the BCL, this description attempts to define a measure for reproducible application, either to compare it to a baseline model, to estimate potential energy savings, or to examine the effects of a particular implementation.    The BCL currently contains more than 30,000 components and measures. A faceted search mechanism has been implemented on the BCL that allows users to filter through the search results using various facets. Facet categories include component and measure types, data source, and energy modeling software type. All attributes of a component or measure can also be used to filter the results.

 - Dataset: Hourly Energy Emission Factors for Electricity Generation in the United States: Emissions from energy use in buildings
are usually estimated on an annual basis using annual average multipliers.  Using annual numbers provides a reasonable
estimation of emissions, but it provides no indication of the temporal nature
of the emissions.  Therefore, there is no
way of understanding the impact on emissions from load
shifting and peak shaving technologies such as thermal energy storage, on-site
renewable energy, and demand control.  

This project utilized GridViewTM, an
electric grid dispatch software package, to estimate hourly emission
factors for all of the [eGRID](http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-resources/egrid/) subregions in the continental United
States. These factors took into account electricity imports and exports
across the eGRID subregion boundary, and included estimated
transmission and distribution (T) losses.  Emission types accounted for included carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2).Data
reported as part of this project include hourly average, minimum, and
maximum emission factors by month; that is, the average, minimum, and
maximum emission factor for the same hour of each day in a month.
Please note that the data are reported in lbs/MWh, where the MWh value
reported is site electricity use (the actual electricity used at the
building) and the pounds of emissions reported are the emissions
created at the generator to meet the building load, including
transmission and distribution losses. The demand profiles used to
generate the data pertain to the following years: eastern interconnect
- 2005; Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) - 2008;
Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) - 2008.
 - Dataset: Comparative Analysis of Alternative Means for Removing Noncondensable Gases from Flashed-Steam Geothermal Power Plants:April 1999 - March 2000: This dataset corresponds to the final report on a screening study to compare six methods of removing noncondensable gases from direct-use geo-thermal steam power plants. This report defines the study methodologies and compares the performance and economics of selected gas-removal systems. Recommendations are presented for follow-up investigations and implementation of some of the technologies discussed. The specific gas-removal methods include five vacuum system configurations using the conventional approach of evacuating gas/vapor mixtures from the power plant condenser system and a system for physical separation of steam and gases upstream of the power turbine. The study focused on flashed-steam applications, but the results apply equally well to flashed-steam and dry-steam geothermal power plant configurations. Two gas-removal options appear to offer profitable economic potential. The hybrid vacuum system configurations and the reboiler process yield positive net present value results over wide-ranging gas concentrations. The hybrid options look favorable for both low-temperature and high-temperature resource applications. The reboiler looks profitable for low-temperature resource applications for gas levels above about 20,000 parts per million by volume. A vacuum system configuration using a three-stage turbocompressor battery may be profitable for low-temperature resources, but results show that the hybrid system is more profitable. The biphase eductor alternative cannot be recommended for commercialization at this time. 
The report is available from NREL's publication database.

 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Alaska Low Resolution Concentrating Solar Power Resource: _Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for Alaska.

_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for Alaska. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.

_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. Units are in watt hours.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Net Power (Summer Average): This shapefile represents seasonal summer average net power estimates.

The OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location, given three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between warm surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C) at the given depth, relative to the surface temperature.

In order to normalize values for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world, a baseline plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been optimized for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power output as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the world, especially in areas with high energy costs.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) | Seawater Cooling - Depth Profile 20ºC (Annual Average): This shapefile represents the annual average depth profile to reach water at a temperature of 20ºC.

Sea water cooling can be used for industrial or residential cooling needs where heat must be rejected. A typical resource for direct air-conditioning applications is no warmer than 8ºC, which has been established as a minimum value of interest for this study. Water at temperatures between 8ºC and 20ºC can be used to supplement air conditioning processes, or to reject heat from many other low temperature industrial processes. Water temperatures above 20ºC were not considered for this investigation as cost savings begin to break down as sea water temperature nears ambient temperatures. Depth profiles for three water temperatures of interest: 8ºC, 14ºC and 20ºC were established to aid selection of optimal sites for sea water cooling. A cool shallow resource just off the coast where a need may exist presents significant opportunity for energy and cost savings.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - delta T (Summer Average): This shapefile represents seasonal summer average delta T estimates.

ΔT represents the difference in temperature (°C) between the warm and cold water sources used by an OTEC plant at a specific location. Warm water is defined uniformly as water at a depth of 20 m, while cold water is defined for each point by locating the depth that leads to the greatest annual net power when each depth and ΔT along the thermocline are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Cold Water Depth (Winter Average): This shapefile represents seasonal winter average cold water depth recordings.

The cold water is defined by locating the depth that leads to the greatest average annual net power at each location when depth and its corresponding ΔT are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe. Input depth and temperature values are obtained from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and are reported at discrete depth levels. The cut-off for maximum cold water depth is 1000 m.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - delta T (Annual Average): This shapefile represents annual average delta T estimates.

ΔT represents the difference in temperature (°C) between the warm and cold water sources used by an OTEC plant at a specific location. Warm water is defined uniformly as water at a depth of 20 m, while cold water is defined for each point by locating the depth that leads to the greatest annual net power when each depth and ΔT along the thermocline are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) | Seawater Cooling - Depth Profile 8ºC (Summer Average): This shapefile represents the seasonal summer depth profile to reach water at a temperature of 8ºC.

Sea water cooling can be used for industrial or residential cooling needs where heat must be rejected. A typical resource for direct air-conditioning applications is no warmer than 8ºC, which has been established as a minimum value of interest for this study. Water at temperatures between 8ºC and 20ºC can be used to supplement air conditioning processes, or to reject heat from many other low temperature industrial processes. Water temperatures above 20ºC were not considered for this investigation as cost savings begin to break down as sea water temperature nears ambient temperatures. Depth profiles for three water temperatures of interest: 8ºC, 14ºC and 20ºC were established to aid selection of optimal sites for sea water cooling. A cool shallow resource just off the coast where a need may exist presents significant opportunity for energy and cost savings.

 - Dataset: Wind Resources by Class and Country At 50m: These estimates are derived from a composite of high resolution wind resource datasets modeled for specific countries with low resolution data originating from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (United States) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (United States) as processed for use in the IMAGE model.

The high resolution datasets were produced by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (United States), Risø DTU National Laboratory (Denmark), the National Institute for Space Research (Brazil), and the Canadian Wind Energy Association. 

The data represents wind power class intervals 3 through 7 at 50 meters above ground *(onshore wind estimates only)*. Wind class is derived from the capacity factor obtained from the [20 Percent Wind Energy by 2030 table B-10](http://www.20percentwind.org/report/Appendix%20B_Assumptions_Used_for_Wind_Deployment_System_Model.pdf). The range was created from years 2005 and 2010.
 - Dataset: Wind Energy Resource Data: NREL's Geographic Information System (GIS) team offers both a national wind resource assessment of the United States and high-resolution wind data. The national wind resource assessment was created for the U.S. Department of Energy in 1986 by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory and is documented in the Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States, October 1986. This national wind resource data provides an estimate of the annual average wind resource for the conterminous United States, with a resolution of 1 3 degree of latitude by 1 4 degree of longitude.    The wind resource assessment was based on surface wind data, coastal marine area data, and upper-air data, where applicable. In data-sparse areas, three qualitative indicators of wind speed or power were used when applicable: topographic meteorological indicators (e.g. gorges, mountain summits, sheltered valleys); wind deformed vegetation; and eolian landforms (e.g. playas, sand dunes). The data was evaluated at a regional level to produce 12 regional wind resource assessments; the regional assessments were then incorporated into the national wind resource assessment.    The conterminous United States was divided into grid cells 1 4 degree of latitude by 1 3 degree of longitude. Each grid cell was assigned a wind power class ranging from 1 to 6, with 6 being the windiest. The wind power density limits for each wind power class are shown in Table 1-1. Each grid cell contains sites of varying power class. The assigned wind power class is representative of the range of wind power densities likely to occur at exposed sites within the grid cell. Hilltops, ridge crests, mountain summits, large clearings, and other locations free of local obstruction to the wind will be well exposed to the wind. In contrast, locations in narrow valleys and canyons, downwind of hills or obstructions, or in forested or urban areas are likely to have poor wind exposure.
 - Dataset: India Direct Normal & Global Horizontal Irradiance Solar Resources: GIS data for India's direct normal irradiance (DNI) and global horizontal irradiance.

Provides 10-kilometer (km) solar resource maps and data for India. The 10-km hourly solar resource data were developed using weather satellite (METEOSAT) measurements incorporated into a site-time specific solar modeling approach developed at the U.S. State University of New York at Albany. The data is made publicly available in geographic information system (GIS) format (shape files etc).

The new maps and data were released in June 2013. The new data expands the time period of analysis from 2002-2007 to 2002-2011 and incorporates enhanced aerosols information to improve direct normal irradiance (DNI).

These products were developed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in cooperation with India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, through funding from the U.S. Department of Energy and U.S. Department of State.
 - Dataset: NREL GIS Data: Alaska Low Resolution Photovoltaic Solar Resource: _Abstract:_  Monthly and annual average solar resource potential for Alaska.

_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for Alaska. The insolation values represent the average solar energy available to a flat plate collector, such as a photovoltaic panel, oriented due south at an angle from horizontal equal to the latitude of the collector location.

_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain. 
Units are in watt hours.

 - Dataset: Energy Innovation Portal: About the Energy Innovation Portal. The Energy Innovation Portal is a one-stop resource for Department of Energy (DOE) Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) technologies. This application enables users to locate technologies developed with DOE funding and available for licensing. These technologies can be viewed as marketing summaries, which provide business friendly descriptions of the technology, or the patent itself. When you find a technology you are interested in, simply fill out the contact form to get directly in touch with the licensing representative from each laboratory.  Creation of the Energy Innovation Portal. In its proposal to manage the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, the Alliance for Sustainable Energy LLC came up with the concept for an Intellectual Portal (IP Portal). The IP Portal was to be a single source for national laboratories, and other stakeholders (such as university partners) to post high quality marketing summaries with the hope of increasing licensing deal flow. Many times, potential licensees of laboratory technology had mentioned the difficulty that they experienced while searching for licensing opportunities. The Energy Innovation Portal (the new name of the IP Portal) was designed to help alleviate this concern, and to simultaneously improve the opportunities for cross-lab intellectual property (IP) bundling.    NREL, initially in collaboration with Battelle Memorial Institute, created the technical architecture and executed the software development for the Energy Innovation Portal, including the selection and integration of more than 50 software applications. The Java-based website employs a MySQL relational database management system and includes a search engine tuned to meet the needs of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. NREL oversaw the initial development, and executed the subsequent improvements, of a customized software script to automatically populate the MySQL database with more than 16,000 DOE-created patents and patent applications. The data was sourced from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Patents from DOE national laboratories are filed under the names of their managing organizations— for NREL, it was previously the Midwest Research Institute and is now the Alliance for Sustainable Energy— but an improved algorithm associated laboratory contract number and management organizations to the laboratories themselves, allowing users to find the relevant patents by simply searching for NREL or the names of the other national labs.    Licensing DOE Technologies. As research performed within the DOE National Laboratories develops into promising discoveries, patents are pursued to protect the intellectual property. For-profit entities can leverage DOE investments in early-stage and applied research by licensing these intellectual properties to develop the technology toward commercial application.    The licensing process is slightly different across national laboratories, so contact the licensing representative listed at the bottom of each marketing summary to discuss your options and start the process.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) | Seawater Cooling - Depth Profile 14ºC (Annual Average): This shapefile represents the annual average depth profile to reach water at a temperature of 14ºC.

Sea water cooling can be used for industrial or residential cooling needs where heat must be rejected. A typical resource for direct air-conditioning applications is no warmer than 8ºC, which has been established as a minimum value of interest for this study. Water at temperatures between 8ºC and 20ºC can be used to supplement air conditioning processes, or to reject heat from many other low temperature industrial processes. Water temperatures above 20ºC were not considered for this investigation as cost savings begin to break down as sea water temperature nears ambient temperatures. Depth profiles for three water temperatures of interest: 8ºC, 14ºC and 20ºC were established to aid selection of optimal sites for sea water cooling. A cool shallow resource just off the coast where a need may exist presents significant opportunity for energy and cost savings.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Cold Water Depth (Annual Average): This shapefile represents annual average cold water depth recordings.

The cold water is defined by locating the depth that leads to the greatest average annual net power at each location when depth and its corresponding ?T are input into the power equation. This optimization balances power gained by obtaining colder water from deeper locations against power lost by transporting the water upward through a longer pipe. Input depth and temperature values are obtained from the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and are reported at discrete depth levels. The cut-off for maximum cold water depth is 1000 m.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Net Power (Winter Average): This shapefile represents seasonal winter average net power estimates.

The OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location, given three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between warm surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C) at the given depth, relative to the surface temperature.

In order to normalize values for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world, a baseline plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been optimized for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power output as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the world, especially in areas with high energy costs.

_Purpose:_  Provide information on the solar resource potential for the for the lower 48 states of the United States of America.

_Supplemental Information:_  This data provides monthly average and annual average daily total solar resource averaged over surface cells of approximatley 40 km by 40 km in size. This data was developed from the Climatological Solar Radiation (CSR) Model. The CSR model was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. Specific information about this model can be found in Maxwell, George and Wilcox (1998) and George and Maxwell (1999). This model uses information on cloud cover, atmostpheric water vapor and trace gases, and the amount of aerosols in the atmosphere to calculate the monthly average daily total insolation (sun and sky) falling on a horizontal surface. The cloud cover data used as input to the CSR model are an 7-year histogram (1985-1991) of monthly average cloud fraction provided for grid cells of approximately 40km x 40km in size. Thus, the spatial resolution of the CSR model output is defined by this database. The data are obtained from the National Climatic Data Center in Ashville, North Carolina, and were developed from the U.S. Air Force Real Time Nephanalysis (RTNEPH) program. Atmospheric water vapor, trace gases, and aerosols are derived from a variety of sources. The procedures for converting the collector at latitude tilt are described in Marion and Wilcox (1994). Where possible, existing ground measurement stations are used to validate the data. Nevertheless, there is uncertainty associated with the meterological input to the model, since some of the input parameters are not avalible at a 40km resolution. As a result, it is believed that the modeled values are accurate to approximately 10% of a true measured value within the grid cell. Due to terrain effects and other micoclimate influences, the local cloud cover can vary significantly even within a single grid cell. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the modeled estimates increase with distance from reliable measurement sources and with the complexity of the terrain.

 - Dataset: Offshore Wind Resource: Global Wind Potential Supply Curves by Country, Class, and Depth (quantities in GW)<br>
 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Net Power (Annual Average): This shapefile represents annual average net power estimates.

The OTEC Plant model predicts the net power production at a specific location, given three inputs: surface temperature (°C), depth (m), and difference between warm surface water temperature and cold deep sea water temperature (ΔT in °C) at the given depth, relative to the surface temperature.

In order to normalize values for the purposes of visualization of the OTEC resource around the world, a baseline plant design was used. The baseline 100MW Net Power design has been optimized for conditions indicative of the Hawai‘i OTEC resource. As such, power output as described by the results of this study is not optimized for local conditions (except in parts of Hawai’i), but does provide guidance for site selection. Given the nominal plant power output of 100MW based on a competitive cost of electricity (Hawai’i), any output exceeding this value represents significant potential. A large area of predicted 100 MW+ net power exists in many locations around the world, especially in areas with high energy costs.

 - Dataset: Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) - Plant Spacing Estimates: This shapefile represents estimated plant spacing distances.

The estimates shown here were obtained considering the availability of cold water at a particular location based on two criteria, the deep-water velocities from HYCOM and a layer-depth constraint estimated from the global OTEC potential of 5 TW. A simple mass budget approach allows estimation of plant spacing; the estimates were further constrained to be no smaller than 3.6 km, based on infrastructure considerations.

The toolkit helps energy planners, project developers, researchers and others identify areas of a country that show good potential for renewable energy projects. The toolkit displays renewable energy data along with information about the geography, location of population centers, borders, and transportation and power infrastructure.
<br><br>
The toolkit is integrated with HOMER, a power system simulation and optimization model, originally developed at NREL and currently owned by HOMER Energy LLC. HOMER integration with the toolkit makes it possible to automatically populate HOMER inputs using weather data from the toolkit to help you get started with your HOMER analysis. The toolkit also displays preliminary HOMER results that you can see without running the model.
<br><br>
NREL works with different funding partners to develop toolkits for different countries. Institutions in each country provide data for the toolkit, which NREL analyzes and prepares to meet the toolkit specifications. Geographic data for each country comes from different sources, including NREL's renewable resource database, resource assessment programs in each country, and government ministries and research institutions responsible for maintaining geographic datasets for the country.

 - Dataset: Global CFDDA-based Onshore and Offshore Wind Potential Supply Curves by Country, Class, and Depth (quantities in GW and PWh): This dataset contains global onshore and offshore wind supply curves based on a resource assessment performed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) based on the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Climate Four Dimensional Data Assimilation (CFDDA) mesoscale climate database. This overview is intended to provide a brief description of the origin of the tables in this workbook, not to fully explain the assumptions and calculations involved. A forthcoming paper will include full detail of sources and assumptions.

The supply curves are defined by country and resource quality. Onshore supply curves are further differentiated by distance to nearest large load or power plant, and offshore by distance to shore and water depth.

The CFDDA database contains hourly wind velocity vectors at a 40km grid, at multiple heights above ground level. For each grid cell, we create hourly wind speed distributions at 90m hub heights, and we compute gross capacity factor through convolution with a representative power curve. Output is derated for outages and wake losses to obtain net capacity factor. Onshore, we assumed a composite IEC Class II turbine; offshore, an IEC Class I turbine. We assumed a wind turbine density of 5 MW/km².
Land and sea area are characterized by country (or country-like object, e.g, Alaska), land use/land cover, elevation, and protection status. Protected, urban, and high-elevation areas are fully excluded, and certain land cover types are fractionally excluded. Offshore, area within 5 nautical miles of or farther than 100 nautical miles from shore are excluded, as are protected marine areas. Marine areas are assigned to country based on exclusive economic zones; unassigned or disputed areas are excluded.
As alluded to previously, in this workbook, "United States of America" refers only to the continental U.S. Alaska and Hawaii are counted separately because of their remoteness. Unassigned "countries" comprise relatively remote, unpopulated areas (Alaska, Greenland, remote islands); and disputed marine areas. We recommend that their resource remain unassigned rather than grouped into larger IAM regions. 

This product is a set of tables containing GW or PWh of technical wind resource potential, by net capacity factor, binned by distance to load/shore and water depth (for offshore). The power and energy quantities are computed independently, each from individual grid cells, so there is not a direct capacity-factor conversion between the two. We have not made assumptions about social or political pressures beyond the exclusion of protected areas, urban areas, and the land use/land cover exclusions introduced above. We have also tried to stay upstream of questions about the economic viability of wind development: i.e., the supply curves are independent of wind turbine cost. We leave the questions of economics to the models.

At the right of each table are columns of total and available land (or sea) area by country. Available area is area remaining for wind development after all geospatial exclusions are applied.

 - Dataset: Form EIA-861, "Annual Electric Power Industry Report.": This is an electric utility data file that includes such information as peak
 load, generation, electric purchases, sales, revenues, customer counts 
and demand-side management programs, green pricing and net metering 
programs, and distributed generation capacity. The data source is the 
survey Form EIA-861, "Annual Electric Power Industry Report." Data for 
all years are final.

The file F861yr09.exe is a file of data collected on
 the Form EIA-861, Annual Electric Power Industry Report, for the 
reporting period, calendar year 2009.   The zipped .exe file contains 11
 .xls files and one Word file, and a .pdf of the Form EIA-861.  The data
 file structure detailed here also applies to data files for prior 
years.

* File1 contains aggregate operational data such as control area operators (years prior to 2005), energy balance, and revenue information from each electric utility in the country, including power marketers, and Federal power marketing administrations.
* File1_cao contains (2005 forward) data on control area operators.
* File1_a (2007 forward) contains data on the types of activities each utility engages in, the NERC regions of operation, whether the utility generates power, and if it operates alternative-fueled vehicles.
* File2 contains information on retail revenue, sales, and customer counts, by State and class of service (including the Transportation sector, new in 2003), for each electric distribution utility, or energy service provider in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, the Dominion of Puerto Rico, and the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands.
* File3 contains information on electric utility demand-side management programs, including energy efficiency and load management effects and expenditures, and (2007 forward) the number of customers in time- and incentive-based rate programs (peak data is in megawatts for 2001 forward – in previous years the data are in kilowatts).
* File3a (2007 forward) contains the cost percentages by state of energy efficiency and load management programs.
* File4 contains the names of the counties, by State, in which the respondent has equipment for the distribution of electricity to ultimate consumers.
* File5 contains aggregate data of the number of customers by State and customer class for Green Pricing and Net Metering programs, as well as (for 2007 forward) the revenue and sales from Green Pricing programs and the energy displaced by Net Metering programs.
* File6 contains information on utility or customer-owned distributed and dispersed generation such as the number, capacity and types of generators.
* File7 (2007 forward) contains data on mergers and acquisitions
* File8 (2007 forward) contains data on advanced meters.
		
Note: All sales data, including energy efficiency 
savings, are in megawatthours, peak and peak reduction data are in 
megawatts for 2001 forward and kilowatts for previous years, all revenue
 and expenditure data are in thousand-dollar units.

Final data for the years 1990 through 1998 are in 
self-extracting zip files which expand into 5 DBF files (F861TYP1.DBF, 
F861TY2A.DBF, F861TY2B.DBF, F861TYP3.DBF, F861TYP7DBF); and Notepad 
versions of the file layout ("layout"), the Form EIA-861 (WordPerfect), 
and EIA-861 Instructions (instr.wpd). To expand the file, type 
F861yy.EXE* (requires 5-6 megs space). The file structure for the years 
1990 through 1998 differs from that for the 1999 and 2000 files 
described in the preceding paragraph. The primary difference is that 
file F861TYP1.DBF contains a combination of data available in the 1999, 
2000, and 2001 in file1.xls and file2.dbf. Utility retail sales data, 
for utilities with sales in 3 or more States are shown in F861TYP3.dbf 
for the third, fourth, fifth, etc., States. Utility Demand-side 
Management information for the years 1990 through 1998 is available in 
F861TY2A.DBF and F861TY2B.DBF.

 - Dataset: Form EIA-826 Database Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue Data: <p class="Bodypara">EIA previously collected sales and revenue data in a
 category called "Other." This category was defined as including 
activities such as public street highway lighting, other sales to public
 authorities, sales to railroads and railways, and interdepartmental 
sales. EIA has revised its survey to separate the transportation sales 
and reassign the other activities to the commercial and industrial 
sectors as appropriate.</p>
	<p class="Bodypara">This is an electric utility data file that includes
 utility level retail sales of electricity and associated revenue by 
end-use sector, State, and reporting month. The data source is the 
survey: Form EIA-826, "Monthly Electric Utility Sales and Revenue Report
 with State Distributions." The Form EIA-826 is used to collect retail 
sales of electricity and associated revenue, each month, from a 
statistically chosen sample of electric utilities in the United States. 
The respondents to the Form EIA-826 are chosen from the Form EIA-861, 
"Annual Electric Utility Report." The data also include, for each State,
 a record (UTILITYID "000000") containing data values which represent 
the arithmetic differences between the "estimated" State totals and the 
sum of the retail sales and associated revenue data reported by the 
respondents to the Form EIA-826. </p>
	<p class="Bodypara">The data are compressed into a self-extracting (f826yyyy.exe)<sup>*</sup> zip file. This self-extracting zip file expands into one DBF file (f826utilyyyy.dbf)<sup>*</sup> that contains the yearly data and an ASCII text file (f826layoutyyyy.txt)<sup>*</sup> that contains the file description and record layout for the data base structure. <b>The
 current year's file will be a year-to-date file and is maintained in 
this monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized.</b><br>
        <br>
	  To expand the self-extracting zip file, type f826yyyy.exe<sup>*</sup>
 from a DOS window, or double click on the file name from File Manager 
in Windows 3x or Windows Explorer in either Windows 95, Windows 98, 
Windows 2000, XP, or ME. Or, click Start, then Run, then select name of 
.EXE file to open, then "OK." (Requires approx. 600K space). Usually, 
the current year's file will be a "year-to-date" file until the data for
 the final month is finalized.<br>

 - Dataset: U.S. State Wind Resource Potential: Estimates for each of the 50 states and the entire United States showing the windy land area with a gross capacity factor (without losses) of 30% and greater at 80-m height above ground and the wind energy potential from development of the “available” windy land area after exclusions.  The “Installed Capacity” shows the potential megawatts (MW) of rated capacity that could be installed on the available windy land area, and the “Annual Generation” shows annual wind energy generation in gigawatt-hours (GWh) that could be produced from the installed capacity.  AWS Truewind, LLC developed the wind resource data for [windNavigator](http://navigator.awstruewind.com/) with a spatial resolution of 200 m.  NREL produced the estimates of windy land area and windy energy potential, including filtering the estimates to exclude areas unlikely to be developed such as wilderness areas, parks, urban areas, and water features (see the "Wind Resource Exclusion Table" sheet within the Excel file for more detail).
 - Dataset: U. S. Department of Energy's Compliance Certification Database: The Certification Database houses certification reports and compliance statements submitted by manufacturers for covered products and equipment subject to Federal conservation standards. The new database offers users an easy-to-use search function for existing records in an easily downloadable format. There is also a consumer-friendly selection tool as well as a search-by-model function. The public certification database houses only certification records of current basic models that have been submitted within the past year. While manufacturers may submit new information daily, the certification database will be updated approximately every two weeks to allow DOE time to actively review all submissions.    The data provided are the representations certified to DOE by manufacturers and their third party representatives. DOE makes no representations or warranties regarding the accuracy of the data. A note for parties that have submitted certification data: The public certification database has no legal significance. When a certification report is submitted in CCMS, the system automatically sends out an email confirmation of the submittal, which is the submitter's proof of having submitted the certification report to the Department. The regulatory requirement is fulfilled upon submission of a certification report that complies with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 429 - not upon posting on this site.
 - Dataset: National Biorefineries Database: This phase of the project began with the development of a geodatabase with the focus predominantly on Ethanol. The task involved collection of data on ethanol production locations, transportation networks, production and storage capacities, transloading and blending locations and geographic marketing areas. The data were obtained by contacting the authorized person(s) in the ethanol plants. The plant contact information was gathered from the related websites, the exact physical location of the plant was verified, the production and storage capacity at the location, the mode of transportation used to ship ethanol to the marketer and the loading capacity were also obtained from the source. The contact information of the person had also been recorded for future reference. The information obtained had been updated to the geodatabase. Few organizations have been reluctant to share information due to proprietary issues.

The second task in this phase was to obtain the closest latitude and longitude positions to the plant locations and transloading terminals in order to generate the shape files. This was accomplished using relevant websites available online [3] [4] [5]. The websites provided the latitude and longitude for the given address. The location was then verified using the satellite view. This was helpful in most cases as the satellite view showed the plant at the location. In few other cases the location was offset from the original position thereby giving an incorrect latitude and longitude. This was rectified by taking the exact latitude and longitude based on the satellite view. For those locations without a proper satellite view, an approximate position was taken. The latitude and longitude for the transloading locations were also obtained the similar way in most cases, the verification of the locations and collecting data on the storage capacity at these locations are under progress.

The third task began with the collection of geospatial data on biodiesel plants which is being progressed in a similar manner. The current focus is on biodiesel plants with a production capacity of more than 10mgy. This limit was set as most biodiesel plants with low production capacity were catering to a local market thus making it difficult to understand the distribution on a national level as the project is more focused on that aspect.

 - Dataset: Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials: Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Guidance on materials selection for hydrogen service is needed to support the deployment of hydrogen as a fuel as well as the development of codes and standards for stationary hydrogen use, hydrogen vehicles, refueling stations, and hydrogen transportation. Materials property measurement is needed on deformation, fracture and fatigue of metals in environments relevant to this hydrogen economy infrastructure. The identification of hydrogen-affected material properties such as strength, fracture resistance and fatigue resistance are high priorities to ensure the safe design of load-bearing structures.

To support the needs of the hydrogen community, Sandia National Laboratories ("Sandia") is conducting an extensive review of reports and journal publications to gather existing materials data for inclusion in the *Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials*. Additionally, Sandia is working internationally with collaborators to acquire newly generated data for inclusion in the Technical Reference. **SAND2012-7321** is an archival report issued by Sandia National Laboratories representing the reference information compiled as of September 2012. Updates and additions of individual sections of this report are available at http://www.sandia.gov/matlsTechRef .

### Technical Database for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials
The Technical Database for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials is intended to be a complement to the Technical Reference for Hydrogen Compatibility of Materials. Although still in the development stage, the Technical Database will provide a repository of technical data measured in hydrogen and is meant to be an engineering tool to aid the selection of materials for use in hydrogen.

The structure of the Technical Database will mirror the Technical Reference, using the same designations and classifications of materials. Below are some examples of the database information that is being compiled in the form of spreadsheets. A single material from a single study is represented in each spreadsheet: the material is indicated by the first four digits; the author and year are represented by the following characters; and the type of data follows (i.e. tensile, fracture and/or fatigue).

 - Dataset: Federal Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Performance: The Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) provides progress data tables illustrating Federal agency progress in meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets established under Executive Order (E.O.) 13514, as well as the comprehensive greenhouse gas inventories as reported by the Federal agencies: Federal Agency Progress Toward Reduction TargetsMicrosoft Excel: View overall government and Federal agency reductions in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions categories.  Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, Fiscal Year (FY) 2012. Includes all greenhouse gas emissions as reported by Federal agencies, including emissions from sources not subject to the reduction targets.  Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2011 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2010 - Federal Agency Comprehensive GHG Inventories, FY 2008    Fiscal year (FY) 2009 inventories are not available because FY 2010 was the first year agencies were required to report under E.O. 13514. FY 2008 base year inventories were also reported at that time.    Federal GHG Requirements Overview    E.O. 13514 required Federal agencies to set individual targets for reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. When all agency targets are combined, the overall target for the entire Federal Government is a 28% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. GHG emissions from certain types of activities are not subject to the reduction targets, including emissions from generation of electric power sold to others and from fuels used in excluded vehicles and equipment (such as tactical, combat support, law enforcement, emergency response, and spaceflight operations).    Similarly, separate targets were established for indirect Scope 3 GHG emissions with a combined Federal Government target of a 13% reduction in FY 2020 compared to FY 2008. Read the White House Council on Environmental Quality's Guidance for Federal Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Inventories under E.O. 13515.

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR), filtered spectral data, precipitation mode, cross-polarized mode: No description found
 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar, filtered spectral data, co-polarized mode: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) Cross-Wind RHI Scan: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.

 - Dataset: AOS: Aethalometer, measures Black Carbon: The aethalometer provides a real-time readout of the concentration of “black” or “elemental” carbon aerosol particles (BC or E) in an air stream. It measures the rate of change of optical transmission through a spot on a filter where aerosol is continuously collected and calculates the concentration of optically absorbing material in the sample. With a built-in reference check of the optical source and a mass flowmeter to monitor air flow rate, the aethalometer calculates the mean BC content of the sampled air stream and provides on-the-spot readout.

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): filtered spectral data, high sensitivity mode, co-polarized mode: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: Ozone Monitoring Instrument: The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) distinguishes between aerosol types, such as smoke, dust, and sulfates, and can measure cloud pressure and coverage, which provide data to derive tropospheric ozone. OMI continues the TOMS record for total ozone and other atmospheric parameters related to ozone chemistry and climate. The OMI instrument is mounted on the EOS Aura platform and employs hyperspectral imaging in a push-broom mode to observe solar backscatter radiation in the visible and ultraviolet. The hyperspectral capabilities improve the accuracy and precision of the total ozone amounts and also allow for accurate radiometric and wavelength self-calibration over the long term.
This instrument is a contribution of the Netherlands&#8217;s Agency for Aerospace Programs (NIVR) in collaboration with the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) to the EOS Aura mission.

 - Dataset: Solar and Infrared Radiation Station (SIRS): broadband shortwave and longwave radiation: The Solar Infrared Radiation Station (SIRS) provides continuous measurements of broadband shortwave (solar) and longwave (atmospheric or infrared) irradiances for downwelling and upwelling components. These 1-minute data are collected from a network of stations to help determine the total energy exchange within the Southern Great Plains site.
Note: The current SIRS instrument suite was preceded by the ARM operational broadband instrument suite and by the Solar and Infrared Radiation Observation Station (SIROS) instrument suite, which included the MFRSR. The change to SIRS occurred in 1997-1998.

 - Dataset: Doppler Lidar User Defined Scan: The Doppler Lidar (DL) is an active remote-sensing instrument that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of the line-of-sight component of air velocity (i.e., radial velocity) and attenuated aerosol backscatter. The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

 - Dataset: G-band (183 GHz) Vapor Radiometer profiler: 15 microwave brightness temperatures from 170.0 to 183.3 GHz: The G-Band Vapor Radiometer Profiler (GVRP) provides time-series measurements of brightness temperatures from 15 channels between 170 and 183.31 GHz. Atmospheric emission in this spectral region is primarily due to water vapor, with some influence from liquid water. The wing channels between 170 and 175 GHz have sensitivity to the presence of liquid water. The sensitivity to water vapor of the 183.31-GHz line is approximately 30 times higher than at the frequencies of the two-channel microwave radiometer (MWR) for a precipitable water vapor (PWV) amount of less than 2.5 mm. Measurements from this instrument are especially useful during low-humidity conditions (PWV &lt; 5 mm).

 - Dataset: AOS: Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (Dual Column), non-ramping mode: The cloud condensation nuclei counter measures the concentration of aerosol particles by drawing an air sample through a column with thermodynamically unstable supersaturated water vapor that can condense onto aerosol particles. Particles that are activated, i.e. grown larger in the process, are counted and sized by an Optical Particle Counter (OPC). In this way the CCN measures activated ambient aerosol particle number concentration as a function of supersaturation.
The ARM Facility operates both one- and two-column versions of the CCN.

Diagnostic data derived from ECMWF model runs are especially generated for ARM analysis for the ACRF facilities. In addition, ARM purchases more detailed ECMWF products covering a larger area for the TWP sites. 
These data can only be distributed to ARM scientists. ARM scientists who obtain these data must agree to acknowledge use of the data in their publications and not to share the data with others who are not on the ARM Science Team. Permission can be requested to supply data to groups outside the ARM Facility for specific projects. In such cases, if permission was given, a conditions form would be produced by ECMWF to be signed by the principal investigator of such a group.

 - Dataset: Aerosol Observing System (AOS): aerosol data, 60-min avg, mentor-QC applied: The aerosol observing system (AOS) is the primary platform for in situ aerosol measurements at Earth’s surface. Each AOS has a different complement of instruments, which are selected to ensure the best measurements at each deployment site.
The AOS measures aerosol optical properties to better understand how particles interact with solar radiation and influence the earth&#8217;s radiation balance. These measurements are useful for calculating parameters used in radiative forcing calculations, such as the aerosol single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, mass scattering efficiency, and hygroscopic growth. Measurements made with the AOS form a long-term record at the ARM fixed sites. Shorter measurement records are available from mobile deployments at a wide variety of geographical regions.  These measurements are valuable for:
<ul>
<li>identifying long-term changes in aerosol properties</li>
<li>identifying atmospheric processes controlling aerosol life cycle and their influence on clouds</li>
<li>providing experimental data for developing and testing atmospheric climate models.</li>

 - Dataset: Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) Zenith Centered RHI Scan: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (20 kW peak power).
Beamwidths for Ka-bands paired with W-bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees. The X-band beamwidth is approximately 1 degree. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

 - Dataset: AOS: Single spot AethalometerÂ®: The aethalometer provides a real-time readout of the concentration of “black” or “elemental” carbon aerosol particles (BC or E) in an air stream. It measures the rate of change of optical transmission through a spot on a filter where aerosol is continuously collected and calculates the concentration of optically absorbing material in the sample.

The profiles are derived from measurements of absolute microwave radiances (expressed as &#8220;brightness temperatures&#8221;) obtained at 12 frequencies in the range of 22-30 GHz and 51-59 GHz.

 - Dataset: W-Band ARM Scanning Cloud Radar (WSACR) Filtered Spectral Data of Vertically Pointing Scan in Cross-Polarization Mode: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power).

 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VISible channel, high-sun angles  [a0 data is uncalibrated]: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

 - Dataset: Doppler Lidar - calibration scan 2: The Doppler Lidar (DL) is an active remote-sensing instrument that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of the line-of-sight component of air velocity (i.e., radial velocity) and attenuated aerosol backscatter. The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band ARM Scanning Cloud Radar (KASACR) Filtered Spectral Data of Vertically Pointing Scan in Cross-Polarization Mode: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (20 kW peak power).

Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

 - Dataset: Micropulse Lidar (MPL) polarized: cloud base and top heights: The Micropulse Lidar (MPL) is a ground-based, optical, remote-sensing system designed primarily to determine the altitude of clouds; however, it is also used for detection of atmospheric aerosols. The physical principle is the same as for radar. Pulses of energy are transmitted into the atmosphere; the energy scattered back to the transceiver is collected and measured as a time-resolved signal, thereby detecting clouds and aerosols in real time.
From the time delay between each outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the distance to the scatterer is inferred. Post-processing of the lidar return characterizes the extent and properties of aerosols or other particles in a region.

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar, filtered spectral data, co-polarized mode: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

 - Dataset: Multi-angle Snowflake Camera: The Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC) consists of three commercial cameras separated by angles of 36 degrees. Each camera’s field of view is aligned to have a common single focus point about 10 centimeters distant from the cameras. Two near-infrared emitter pairs are aligned with the camera’s field of view within a 10-angular ring to detect hydrometeor passage, with the lower emitters configured to trigger the MASC cameras. The sensitive IR motion sensors are designed to filter out slow variations in ambient light. Fallspeed is derived from successive triggers along the fall path.
The camera exposure times are extremely short, in the range of 1/25,000th of a second, enabling the MASC to capture snowflake sizes ranging from 30 micrometers to 3 centimeters. Any number of images, from zero to thousands, may be collected in a single day. These images are recorded in threes, one for each camera. They show monochrome (black and white) views of hydrometeors separated by 36 degrees.
Particle images acquired by the MASC can support the analysis of solid hydrometeors’ microphysical characteristics with an emphasis on precipitating snow crystals.

In its standard operating mode, dry aerosols are separated into size bins by the first differential mobility analyzer and then exposed to 85% relative humidity. The resulting hygroscopic growth distributions are then scanned by the second differential mobility analyzer for each dry-size bin.

 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (WSACR) Zenith Centered RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (XSACR) Hemispherical Sky RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

In addition to the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectra width), the C-SAPR also provides differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and specific differential phase. The dual-polarization variables enable the provision of rainfall rate estimates and identification of precipitation types.

 - Dataset: 915-MHz Radar Wind Profiler/RASS (RWP915): wind moments: The radar wind profiler/radio acoustic sounding system (RWP/RASS), available in 915-MHz (for U.S. deployments) and 1290-MHz (for foreign deployments), measures wind profiles and backscattered signal strength between (nominally) 0.1 km and 5 km and virtual temperature profiles between 0.1 km and 2.5 km. However, ARM no longer operates the RASS portion.
The RWP transmits electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere in as many as five directions (four tilted in opposing vertical planes and on vertical) and measures the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Calculation of the Doppler shift of the returned signal allows calculation of the atmospheric wind profile.

 - Dataset: Doppler Lidar - calibration scan 1: The Doppler Lidar (DL) is an active remote-sensing instrument that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of the line-of-sight component of air velocity (i.e., radial velocity) and attenuated aerosol backscatter. The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): raw spectral data: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths.

The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (W-SACR) PPI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: X-SAPR: The X-band scanning ARM precipitation radar (X-SAPR) is an X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar. The X-SAPR operates in a simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) mode, meaning that the transmit signal is split so that power is transmitted on both horizontal and vertical polarizations at the same time. The X-SAPR transmitter is a 200 kW (peak power) magnetron. The receiver is based upon the Vaisala RVP-900 and runs Vaisala’s IRIS software.
In addition to the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectra width), the X-SAPR also provides differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and specific differential phases. The dual-polarization variables enable estimates of rainfall rates and identification of precipitation types. At the Southern Great Plains site, three X-SAPRs surround the Central Facility, allowing the use of multi-Doppler velocity retrievals to estimate wind fields.

 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VISible channel, low-sun angles  [a0 data is uncalibrated]: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

This means they observe the Earth from the exact same vantage point all the time.

 - Dataset: W-band (95 GHz) ARM Cloud Radar, filtered spectral data, cross-polarized mode: The W-band Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Facility Cloud Radar (WACR) systems are zenith-pointing Doppler radars that probe the extent and composition of clouds at 95.04 GHz.
The main purpose of this radar is to determine cloud boundaries (e.g., cloud bottoms and tops).
This radar reports estimates for the first three spectra moments for each range gate up to 15 km. The 0th moment is reflectivity, the 1st moment is radial velocity, and the 2nd moment is spectral width. Also available are the raw spectra files.
Unlike the millimeter wavelength cloud radar (MMCR), the WACR does not use pulse coding and operates in only copolarization and cross-polarization modes.

 - Dataset: Multi-Filter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR): irradiances: The visible Multifilter Rotating Shadowband Radiometer (MFRSR) is a passive instrument that measures global and diffuse components of solar irradiance at six narrowband channels and one open, or broadband, channel. Direct irradiance is not a primary measurement, but is calculated using diffuse and global measurements.
To collect one data record, the MFRSR takes measurements at four different shadowband positions. The first measurement is taken with the shadowband in the nadir (home) position. The next three measurements are, in order, the first side-band, sun-blocked, and second side-band. The side-band measurements are used to correct for the portion of the sky obscured by the shadowband. The nominal wavelengths of the narrowband channels are 415, 500, 615, 673, 870, and 940 nm.
From such measurements, the atmosphere’s aerosol optical depth at each wavelength can be inferred. In turn, these optical depths may be used to derive information about the column abundances of ozone and water vapor, as well as aerosol and other atmospheric constituents.

 - Dataset: Micropulse Lidar (MPL) polarized, fast sampling:  cloud base and top heights: The Micropulse Lidar (MPL) is a ground-based, optical, remote-sensing system designed primarily to determine the altitude of clouds; however, it is also used for detection of atmospheric aerosols. The physical principle is the same as for radar. Pulses of energy are transmitted into the atmosphere; the energy scattered back to the transceiver is collected and measured as a time-resolved signal, thereby detecting clouds and aerosols in real time.
From the time delay between each outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the distance to the scatterer is inferred. Post-processing of the lidar return characterizes the extent and properties of aerosols or other particles in a region.

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar, filtered spectral data, cross-polarized mode: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): raw spectral data: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: Doppler Lidar - Plan Position Indicator: The Doppler Lidar (DL) is an active remote-sensing instrument that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of the line-of-sight component of air velocity (i.e., radial velocity) and attenuated aerosol backscatter. The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) Boundary Layer RHI Downwind Scan: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal.

Beamwidths for Ka-bands paired with W-bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees. The X-band beamwidth is approximately 1 degree. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

 - Dataset: Cimel Sunphotometer (CSPHOT): Dubovik almucantar retrievals: The Cimel sunphotometer (CSPHOT) is a multi-channel, automatic sun-and-sky scanning radiometer that measures the direct solar irradiance and sky radiance at the Earth’s surface. It takes measurements at predetermined discrete wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum to determine atmospheric transmission and scattering properties. The CSPHOT only operates during daylight (sun above horizon).

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (XSACR) Cross-Wind RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Zenith, Near-InfraRed channel  [a0 data is uncalibrated]: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Zenith (SASZE) measures the zenith sky shortwave radiance over the spectral range from the near infrared to the ultraviolet.
The SASZE measures sky radiance throughout the day, including twilight before sunrise and after sunset. The SASZE rack with spectroradiometers and data acquisition system is located in a temperature-controlled building isolated from the elements. The SAS measurements can be used to:
<ul>
<li>Retrieve cloud optical depth, particle size, and cloud water path.</li>
<li>Test the cloud optical depth retrieval for overcast and broken cloud fields.</li>
<li>Validation/comparison with Southern Great Plains site surface remote sensors and future cloud field campaigns.</li>
<li>Multivariate analysis to derive information content in hyper-spectral data sets and to improve cloud retrieval algorithm development.</li>
<li>Compare with radiative transfer models for testing and validating retrieval procedures.</li>
</ul>
The SASZE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The sampling frequency is 1 Hz.
The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7. The light collector has a narrow-field-of-view (1° full-angle) collimator at the front end of a high-grade fiber optic.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) Vertically Pointing High-Resolution Scan: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (20 kW peak power).

Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

The condensing liquid is typically an alcohol (e.g., butanol) or water.
Depending on the CPC type, typical CPC instruments can count particles with sizes that range from 3 to 3000 nanometers (ultrafine CPC) or from 10 to 3000 nanometers (fine CPC). The CPC is part of the Aerosol Observing System (AOS).

 - Dataset: In-situ Aerosol Profiles (Cessna Aerosol Flights), averaged at various flight levels: The In Situ Aerosol Profiles (IAP) campaign is a joint effort between the ARM Facility and the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The objective is to obtain a statistically-significant data set of the vertical distribution of aerosol properties (e.g., light scattering and absorption, particle chemistry) by flying a Cessna light aircraft over the SGP site. By using a similar aerosol instrument package as the Aerosol Observing System (AOS) at SGP, the aircraft will fly level legs at altitudes between 500 m and 3500 m several times per week. See the IAP website for more information.

 - Dataset: 1290-MHz Radar Wind Profiler: Precipitation Averages, operating in high power mode: The radar wind profiler/radio acoustic sounding system (RWP/RASS), available in 915-MHz (for U.S. deployments) and 1290-MHz (for foreign deployments), measures wind profiles and backscattered signal strength between (nominally) 0.1 km and 5 km and virtual temperature profiles between 0.1 km and 2.5 km. However, ARM no longer operates the RASS portion.
The RWP transmits electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere in as many as five directions (four tilted in opposing vertical planes and on vertical) and measures the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Calculation of the Doppler shift of the returned signal allows calculation of the atmospheric wind profile.

 - Dataset: AOS: Scanning-Mobility Particle Sizer: The Scanning Mobile Particle Sizer (SMPS) is a particle size spectrometer that measures the aerosol number size distribution by sizing particles based on their electrical mobility diameter using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and by counting particles using a Condensation Particle Counter (CPC).

The SMPS can measure the aerosol number size distribution in the particle diameter range from 10 to 500 nanometers (Regular SMPS) and from 2 to 150 nanometers (Nano SMPS).
The SMPS is part of the Aerosol Observing System (AOS).

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): general mode: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: X-SAPR Plan Position Indicator scan: The X-band scanning ARM precipitation radar (X-SAPR) is an X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar. The X-SAPR operates in a simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) mode, meaning that the transmit signal is split so that power is transmitted on both horizontal and vertical polarizations at the same time. The X-SAPR transmitter is a 200 kW (peak power) magnetron. The receiver is based upon the Vaisala RVP-900 and runs Vaisala’s IRIS software.
In addition to the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectra width), the X-SAPR also provides differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and specific differential phases. The dual-polarization variables enable estimates of rainfall rates and identification of precipitation types. At the Southern Great Plains site, three X-SAPRs surround the Central Facility, allowing the use of multi-Doppler velocity retrievals to estimate wind fields.

 - Dataset: Auxiliary data for the USDA Visible MFRSR: The USDA UV-B Monitoring and Research Program is a program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service (CSREES). The program was initiated in 1992, through a grant to Colorado State University, to provide information on the geographical distribution and temporal trends of UVB (ultraviolet -B) radiation in the United States.
The SGP ARM site is part of the CSREES&#8217;s climatological network. All sites are instrumented with both UV and Visible MFRSR shadowband radiometers and broadband UV-B meters. For more details, see the External Data Center web page.

 - Dataset: 1290-MHz Radar Wind Profiler/RASS (RWP1290): wind moments: The radar wind profiler/radio acoustic sounding system (RWP/RASS), available in 915-MHz (for U.S. deployments) and 1290-MHz (for foreign deployments), measures wind profiles and backscattered signal strength between (nominally) 0.1 km and 5 km and virtual temperature profiles between 0.1 km and 2.5 km. However, ARM no longer operates the RASS portion.
The RWP transmits electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere in as many as five directions (four tilted in opposing vertical planes and on vertical) and measures the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Calculation of the Doppler shift of the returned signal allows calculation of the atmospheric wind profile.

 - Dataset: W-Band ARM Scanning Cloud Radar (WSACR) Filtered Spectral Data of Vertically Pointing High Resolution Scan in Co-Polarization Mode: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (XSACR) Along-Wind RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, Near-InfraRed channel: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

 - Dataset: AOS impactor state corrected with nephelometer pressure: The aerosol observing system (AOS) is the primary platform for in situ aerosol measurements at Earth’s surface. Each AOS has a different complement of instruments, which are selected to ensure the best measurements at each deployment site.
The AOS measures aerosol optical properties to better understand how particles interact with solar radiation and influence the earth&#8217;s radiation balance. These measurements are useful for calculating parameters used in radiative forcing calculations, such as the aerosol single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, mass scattering efficiency, and hygroscopic growth. Measurements made with the AOS form a long-term record at the ARM fixed sites. Shorter measurement records are available from mobile deployments at a wide variety of geographical regions.  These measurements are valuable for:
<ul>
<li>identifying long-term changes in aerosol properties</li>
<li>identifying atmospheric processes controlling aerosol life cycle and their influence on clouds</li>
<li>providing experimental data for developing and testing atmospheric climate models.</li>

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): filtered spectral data, general mode, cross-polarized mode: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (WSACR) Boundary Layer RHI Upwind Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: Multi-Filter Radiometer (MFR): upwelling irradiance at 10-meter height: The multifilter radiometer (MFR) is simply the head from a multifilter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) mounted on a tower pointing at the surface.

 - Dataset: AOS: Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (Dual Column), ramping mode: The cloud condensation nuclei counter measures the concentration of aerosol particles by drawing an air sample through a column with thermodynamically unstable supersaturated water vapor that can condense onto aerosol particles. Particles that are activated, i.e. grown larger in the process, are counted and sized by an Optical Particle Counter (OPC). In this way the CCN measures activated ambient aerosol particle number concentration as a function of supersaturation.

At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars.

For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

However, ARM no longer operates the RASS portion.
The RWP transmits electromagnetic energy into the atmosphere in as many as five directions (four tilted in opposing vertical planes and on vertical) and measures the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. Calculation of the Doppler shift of the returned signal allows calculation of the atmospheric wind profile.

 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (W-SACR) Boundary Layer RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

The raw data are in ASDA (Australian Satellite Data Archive) Format.

 - Dataset: X-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (XSACR) RHI Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). At ARM&#8217;s tropical sites, X-band radars are paired with the Ka-band because they are better suited for the atmospheric attenuation in this region.
Beamwidth for the X-band is approximately 1 degree, and the Ka-band beamwidth is roughly 0.3 degrees. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the X-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
For the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), the X-SACR can be dismounted from the pedestal it shares with the Ka-SACR and mounted on a separate pedestal. This allows the X-SACR to operate more like a weather (precipitation) radar in deployments where such local coverage is lacking.
Measurements collected with the X-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, differential Reflectivity (Zdr), correlation coefficient (rho-hv), and specific differential phase (phi-dp).

These measurements are useful for calculating parameters used in radiative forcing calculations, such as the aerosol single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, mass scattering efficiency, and hygroscopic growth. Measurements made with the AOS form a long-term record at the ARM fixed sites. Shorter measurement records are available from mobile deployments at a wide variety of geographical regions.  These measurements are valuable for:
<ul>
<li>identifying long-term changes in aerosol properties</li>
<li>identifying atmospheric processes controlling aerosol life cycle and their influence on clouds</li>
<li>providing experimental data for developing and testing atmospheric climate models.</li>

 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, Near-InfraRed channel, high-sun angles  [a0 data is uncalibrated]: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

 - Dataset: Balloon-borne sounding system (BBSS): research-mode winds, presssure, temp, &RH: The balloon-borne sounding system (SONDE) provides in situ measurements (vertical profiles) of both the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere, and the wind speed and direction.

 - Dataset: Energy Balance Bowen Ratio(EBBR) station: surf. Met & soil data for heat flux, 5-min: The Energy Balance Bowen Ratio (EBBR) system produces 30-minute estimates of the vertical fluxes of sensible and latent heat at the surface. The EBBR calculates flux estimates from observations of net radiation, soil surface heat flux, and the vertical gradients of temperature and relative humidity. Meteorological data collected by the EBBR are used to calculate bulk aerodynamic fluxes, which are used in the Bulk Aerodynamic Technique (BA) EBBR value-added product (VAP) to replace sunrise and sunset spikes in the flux data. A unique aspect of the system is the automatic exchange mechanism (AEM), which helps reduce errors from instrument offset drift.

 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): filtered spectral data, general mode, cross mode: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: X-SAPR Range Height Indicator scan: The X-band scanning ARM precipitation radar (X-SAPR) is an X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar. The X-SAPR operates in a simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) mode, meaning that the transmit signal is split so that power is transmitted on both horizontal and vertical polarizations at the same time. The X-SAPR transmitter is a 200 kW (peak power) magnetron. The receiver is based upon the Vaisala RVP-900 and runs Vaisala’s IRIS software.
In addition to the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectra width), the X-SAPR also provides differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and specific differential phases. The dual-polarization variables enable estimates of rainfall rates and identification of precipitation types. At the Southern Great Plains site, three X-SAPRs surround the Central Facility, allowing the use of multi-Doppler velocity retrievals to estimate wind fields.

It transmits acoustic energy into the atmosphere in multiple directions and measures the strength and frequency of backscattered energy. The strength of the backscattered signal is determined by the strength of temperature inhomogeneities with size on the order of 10 centimeters (cm). Assuming the scattering elements in the atmosphere are moving with the mean wind, the horizontal wind field can be derived. 
The ARM Mobile Facility (AMF) has a system developed by Scintec, Inc. that transmits a sequence of frequencies to enhance signal determination.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) Corner Reflector Calibration Fixed Point (FP) Scan: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (20 kW peak power).
Beamwidths for Ka-bands paired with W-bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees. The X-band beamwidth is approximately 1 degree. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

The raw data are in ASDA (Australian Satellite Data Archive) Format.

 - Dataset: Doppler Lidar - Patrial Range-Height-Indicator scan: The Doppler Lidar (DL) is an active remote-sensing instrument that provides range- and time-resolved measurements of the line-of-sight component of air velocity (i.e., radial velocity) and attenuated aerosol backscatter. The DL operates in the near-infrared and is sensitive to backscatter from atmospheric aerosol, which are assumed to be ideal tracers of atmospheric wind fields.
The DL works by transmitting short pulses of infrared laser light into the atmosphere Atmospheric aerosols scatter a small fraction of that light energy back to the transceiver, where it is collected and recorded as a time-resolved signal. From the delay between the outgoing pulse and the backscattered signal, the instrument infers the distance to the scattering volume.
Coherent detection is used to measure the Doppler frequency shift of the backscatter signal. This is accomplished by mixing the backscatter signal with a reference laser beam (i.e., local oscillator) of known frequency. The onboard signal processor then determines the Doppler frequency shift from the spectrum of the mixed signal. The Doppler frequency shift and thus the radial air velocity is determined from the peak of the Doppler spectrum. The attenuated backscatter is determined from the energy content of the Doppler spectra.
The DL provides accurate measurements of radial velocity in regions of the atmosphere where aerosol concentrations are high enough to ensure good signal-to-noise ratio. Thus, valid data are usually limited to the atmospheric boundary layer where aerosol is ubiquitous. Valid measurements can also be obtained in elevated aerosol layers or in optically thin clouds above the boundary layer. Most of the ARM DLs have full upper-hemispheric scanning capability, enabling 3D mapping of turbulent flows in the atmospheric boundary layer. With the scanner pointed vertically, the DL provides height- and time-resolved measurements of vertical velocity.

 - Dataset: ARSCL: derived, MMCR Mode 2 (cirrus mode) moments (11/96-2/97): No description found
 - Dataset: High Spectral Resolution Lidar: High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) systems collect data about clouds and aerosols.
These systems provide vertical profiles of optical depth, backscatter cross-section, depolarization, and backscatter phase function. All HSRL measurements are absolutely calibrated by reference to molecular scattering, which is measured at each point in the lidar profile.
Like the Raman lidar, but unlike simple backscatter lidars such as the micropulse lidar, the HSRL can measure backscatter cross-sections and optical depths without prior assumptions about the scattering properties of the atmosphere. The depolarization observations also allow robust discrimination between ice and water clouds. In addition, rigorous error estimates can be computed for all measurements. A very narrow, angular field of view reduces multiple scattering contributions. The small field of view, coupled with a narrow optical bandwidth, nearly eliminates noise due to scattered sunlight.
The ARM facility operates two HSRL systems, one at the Barrow North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site and the other in the second ARM Mobile Facility (AMF2), which is deployed at various locations on field campaigns.

 - Dataset: Pixels from SASHe corresponding to MFR radiometer wavelengths: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

The SMOSs are not calibrated as systems. The sensors and the data logger (which includes the analog-to-digital converter, or A/D) are calibrated separately. All systems are installed using components that have a current calibration. SMOSs have not been installed at extended facilities located within about 10 km of existing surface meteorological stations, such as those of the Oklahoma Mesonet.

 - Dataset: AOS: Dual Column Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter: The cloud condensation nuclei counter measures the concentration of aerosol particles by drawing an air sample through a column with thermodynamically unstable supersaturated water vapor that can condense onto aerosol particles. Particles that are activated, i.e. grown larger in the process, are counted and sized by an Optical Particle Counter (OPC). In this way the CCN measures activated ambient aerosol particle number concentration as a function of supersaturation.
The ARM Facility operates both one- and two-column versions of the CCN.

 - Dataset: W-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (WSACR) Corner Reflector Raster Scan: ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are fully coherent dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (WSACR; 1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (XSACR; 20 kW peak power). Beamwidths at Ka and W bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees.
Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies that are unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data.
Measurements collected with the W-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ration.

 - Dataset: Aerosol Best Estimate, from 1st Turner algorithm: No description found
 - Dataset: Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer-Hemispheric, VISible channel: The Shortwave Array Spectroradiometer—Hemispheric (SASHE) uses a hemispheric spectralon diffuser and rotating shadowband similar to the MFRSR and RSS instruments, so it also provides spectrally resolved, direct-normal, diffuse-horizontal, and total-horizontal irradiances, and can be calibrated in situ via Langley regression.
The SASHE incorporates two Avantes fiber-coupled spectroradiometers (Avaspec ULS 2048 CCD and Avaspec NIR256-1.7) for visible and near-infrared detection in the wavelength range 350-1700 nm. The spectral resolution is 2.4 nm for the ULS 2048 CCD and 6 nm for the NIR256-1.7.
Like the SWS and SASZE, an external collector mounted outdoors is connected via fiber-optic cable to a pair of spectroradiometers housed indoors, so the entire spectral range is measured simultaneously for both spectroradiometers.
For the typical shadowband measurement, the spectroradiometers are operated with one measurement per second, but the entire shadowband sequence takes about 20 seconds, so this is the measurement interval for the irradiances.
The SASHE operating sequence is configurable and supports alternate programmed sequences as a function of solar zenith angle. For example, it currently employs different sequences for high-sun angles, low-sun angles, and twilight conditions when the sun is below the horizon but the sky is not yet fully dark.
It also includes a mode where visible spectra are collected rapidly while the band is moved over a range of near-sun angles to characterize the forward-scattered radiation.
The SASHE data are preliminarily calibrated through comparison with calibrated lamps. The accuracy of irradiance produced by the SASHE is expected to be better than ±5%, which includes calibration and instrument stability errors. Under suitably uniform atmospheric conditions, higher calibration accuracy and precisions (±1%) can be obtained when the responsivity is tied to the solar extraterrestrial irradiance via Langley regression plots. This approach is recommended when high-precision measurements of optical depth are required.

 - Dataset: AOS Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer: The Humidified Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HTDMA) is part of the Aerosol Observing System (AOS).
It measures how aerosol particles of different initial dry sizes grow or shrink when exposed to changing relative humidity (RH). It uses two different mobility analyzers (DMA) and a humidification system to make the measurements.
One DMA selects a narrow size range of dry aerosol particles, which are exposed to varying RH conditions in the humidification system. The second (humidified) DMA scans the particle size distribution output from the humidification system.
Scanning a wide range of particle sizes enables the second DMA to measure changes in size or growth factor (growth factor = humidified size/dry size) due to water uptake by the particles. A Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) downstream of the second DMA counts particles as a function of selected size in order to obtain the number size distribution of particles exposed to different RH conditions.

 - Dataset: Ka-Band ARM Scanning Cloud Radar (KASACR) Filtered Spectral Data of Vertically Pointing High Resolution Scan in Cross-Polarization Mode: The Ka-Band Scanning ARM Cloud Radar (KASACR) records cloud properties.
ARM&#8217;s scanning cloud radars are dual-frequency, dual-polarization Doppler radars mounted on a common scanning pedestal. Each pedestal includes a Ka-band radar (2kW peak power) and the deployment location determines whether the second radar is a W-band (1.7 kW peak power) or X-band (20 kW peak power).
Beamwidths for Ka-bands paired with W-bands are roughly matched at 0.3 degrees. The X-band beamwidth is approximately 1 degree. Due to the narrow antenna beamwidth, ARM’s scanning cloud radars use scanning strategies unlike typical weather radars. Rather than focusing on plan position indicator, or PPI, scans, the Ka-SACR uses range height indicator, or RHI, scans at numerous azimuths to obtain cloud volume data. Measurements collected with the Ka-SACR are copolar and cross-polar radar reflectivity, Doppler velocity, spectra width and spectra when not scanning, and linear depolarization ratio.

 - Dataset: Video Disdrometer Individual Drop Data: A disdrometer measures the drop size distribution and velocity of falling hydrometeors.
The 2-dimensional video-disdrometer (VDIS) comprises video cameras capable of observing individual hydrometeors from views perpendicular to each other. Two CCD line scan cameras are directed towards the measurement area. Objects passing through the measurement area—which is determined by the cross-section of the two optical paths as seen from above—obstruct the light and are detected as shadows by the cameras.
Each camera contains a small embedded computer responsible for handling the data-capture process, analysis of the data, and its conversion and compression into a format suitable for further processing. Subsequently the data are transferred to the computer used for instrument control and final analysis.
In order to identify individual precipitation particles by matching their views as seen by each of the cameras, it is necessary to synchronize the shutter and control both cameras with a synchronous line trigger signal.
To reconstruct observables like falling velocity, oblateness, etc. from the datastreams of the two cameras, the two optical paths are displaced vertically by about 6mm, typically. Measuring this distance and adjusting the background illumination are the two major calibration and maintenance tasks necessary for successful operation of the device.

 - Dataset: AOS: Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (Dual Column), ramping mode spectra data: The cloud condensation nuclei counter measures the concentration of aerosol particles by drawing an air sample through a column with thermodynamically unstable supersaturated water vapor that can condense onto aerosol particles.

 - Dataset: X-SAPR: The X-band scanning ARM precipitation radar (X-SAPR) is an X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar. The X-SAPR operates in a simultaneous transmit and receive (STAR) mode, meaning that the transmit signal is split so that power is transmitted on both horizontal and vertical polarizations at the same time. The X-SAPR transmitter is a 200 kW (peak power) magnetron. The receiver is based upon the Vaisala RVP-900 and runs Vaisala’s IRIS software.
In addition to the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, radial velocity, and spectra width), the X-SAPR also provides differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient, and specific differential phases. The dual-polarization variables enable estimates of rainfall rates and identification of precipitation types. At the Southern Great Plains site, three X-SAPRs surround the Central Facility, allowing the use of multi-Doppler velocity retrievals to estimate wind fields.

 - Dataset: Millimeter Wavelength Cloud Radar (MMCR): spectral data: The millimeter wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) systems probe the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The MMCR is a zenith-pointing radar that operates at a frequency of 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine cloud boundaries (e.g., bottoms and tops). This radar will also report radar reflectivity (dBZ) of the atmosphere up to 20 km. The radar has a Doppler capability that allows  measurement of cloud constituent vertical velocities.

 - Dataset: Cimel Sunphotometer (CSPHOT): almucantars sky radiance data: The Cimel sunphotometer (CSPHOT) is a multi-channel, automatic sun-and-sky scanning radiometer that measures the direct solar irradiance and sky radiance at the Earth’s surface. It takes measurements at predetermined discrete wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared parts of the spectrum to determine atmospheric transmission and scattering properties. The CSPHOT only operates during daylight (sun above horizon).

 - Dataset: Chilled Mirror Dew Point Hygrometer: No description found
 - Dataset: Ka ARM Zenith Radar (KAZR): moderate sensitivity mode: The Ka-band ARM zenith radar (KAZR) remotely probes the extent and composition of clouds at millimeter wavelengths. The KAZR is a zenith-pointing Doppler radar that operates at a frequency of approximately 35 GHz. The main purpose of this radar is to determine the first three Doppler moments (reflectivity, vertical velocity, and spectral width) at a range resolution of approximately 30 meters from near-ground to nearly 20 km in altitude.
The KAZR replaces the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar (MMCR) and uses a new digital receiver that provides higher spatial and temporal resolution than the MMCR. In addition, spectral artifacts in the data are significantly reduced in the KAZR, allowing researchers to study cloud dynamics much more closely than with the MMCR.

 - Dataset: Aerosol Observing System (AOS): aerosol data, 1-min: The aerosol observing system (AOS) is the primary platform for in situ aerosol measurements at Earth’s surface. Each AOS has a different complement of instruments, which are selected to ensure the best measurements at each deployment site.
The AOS measures aerosol optical properties to better understand how particles interact with solar radiation and influence the earth&#8217;s radiation balance. These measurements are useful for calculating parameters used in radiative forcing calculations, such as the aerosol single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, mass scattering efficiency, and hygroscopic growth. Measurements made with the AOS form a long-term record at the ARM fixed sites. Shorter measurement records are available from mobile deployments at a wide variety of geographical regions.  These measurements are valuable for:
<ul>
<li>identifying long-term changes in aerosol properties</li>
<li>identifying atmospheric processes controlling aerosol life cycle and their influence on clouds</li>
<li>providing experimental data for developing and testing atmospheric climate models.</li>
