The information is \"semi-refined\" meaning a police report was taken, but it has not made its way through the court system. This data is subject to change once it is processed and republished using Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards. The UCR coding process creates a necessary delay before processed data is available for publication. Therefore, the 30 Day blotter will provide information for users seeking the most current information available.   \r\n\r\nThis dataset will be continually overwritten and any records older than thirty days will be removed. Validated incidents will be moved to the Police Blotter Archive Dataset. Data in the archived file is of a higher quality and is the file most appropriate for reporting crime statistics. \r\n\r\nThis dataset only contains information reported by City of Pittsburgh Police, and does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city (campus police, Port Authority, etc.)\r\n\r\n[Crime Data Guide](http://www.wprdc.org/crime/)"

Rivers, Lakes, Ponds,\r\nReservoirs, Hidden Lakes, Reservoirs or Ponds: If greater than 25 feet and less\r\nthan 30 feet wide, is captured as a double line stream. If greater than 30 feet\r\nwide it is captured as a river. Lakes are large standing bodies of water\r\ngreater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater\r\nthan 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream\r\nedges and River Edges.\u00a0 The Ohio River,\r\nMonongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major Rivers. All other\r\nRiver and Stream polygons are coded as River. If a stream is less than 25 feet\r\nwide it is placed as a single line and coded as a Stream.\u00a0 Both sides of the stream are digitized and\r\ncoded as a Stream for Streams whose width is greater than 25 feet.\u00a0 River edges are digitized and coded as River.\r\nA Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic feature.\u00a0 Drainage Canals are differentiated from\r\nstreams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or bottom stabilized to\r\nprevent erosion for the predominant length of the feature.\u00a0 Streams may have had some stabilization done,\r\nbut are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large standing bodies of water\r\ngreater than five acres in size.\u00a0 Ponds are\r\nlarge standing bodies of water greater than one acre in size and less than five\r\nacres in size.\u00a0 Reservoirs are manmade\r\nembankments of water.\u00a0 Included in this\r\ndefinition are both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are\r\ngreater than one acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and\r\nHidden Drainage Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water\r\nflows through a manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not\r\nbeing updated but will be preserved.\u00a0 If\r\na drainage feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the\r\nassociated drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a\r\nstructure to which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage.\u00a0 They are normally constructed of concrete and\r\nsteel and are anchored to the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling.\r\nMooring Cells do not currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will\r\nbe added. Locks are devices that are used to control flow or access to a\r\nhydrologic feature.\u00a0 The edges of the\r\nLock are captured.\u00a0 Dams are devices that\r\nare used to hold or delay the natural flow of water.\u00a0 The edges of the Dam are shown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If viewing this description on the Western Pennsylvania\r\nRegional Data Center\u2019s open data portal (<a href=\"http://www.wprdc.org\">http://www.wprdc.org</a>), this\r\ndataset is harvested on a weekly basis from Allegheny County\u2019s GIS data portal\r\n(<a href=\"http://openac.alcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/\">http://openac.alcogis.opendata.arcgis.com/</a>).

The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.\r\n\r\nAs Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.\r\n\r\nAfter a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.\r\n\r\nThe data presented here is in beta form because only the most recent filing type is included as of September 2017.  Monthly updates are forthcoming.  It is also our intent to include a record for each filing type for each docket if the data becomes available."

For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended  weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.\r\n \r\nThe Bureau\u2019s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized.

This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.\r\n\r\nTo protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:\r\n  \r\n* Aggregated event location to census block groups.  \r\n* Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year. \r\n* Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. \r\n* Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  \r\n* Checked frequency of calls w/ sensitive health information: \r\n    * If the number of calls for a certain month/year and census block group was greater than 5, the call description was included.  \r\n    * If less than 5, the call description was redacted. \r\n\r\nEvents requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.\r\n\r\nThe call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller.

      "title": "Allegheny County Elevated Blood Lead Level Rates",
      "description": "Lead is a neurotoxin commonly found in our daily lives. While lead has been eliminated from gasoline, household paint, and solder, you can still be exposed to lead from many different sources including dust containing lead from pre-1978 lead paint, paint chips, contaminated soils, water, ceramic plates, bowls, and glasses, and imported candy, toys, cosmetics, and jewelry\r\n\r\nLead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, academic achievement, and other behavioral issues.\r\n\r\nAs of January 1, 2018, Allegheny County requires every child under age six to be tested for lead exposure. The first of two tests will be conducted when a child is approximately 9-12 months old, and the second test will take place around the child\u2019s second birthday. According to the Allegheny County Health Department, 53% of County children born in 2016 were tested for lead between the ages of nine to 12 months. This share has risen from 30% of County children born in 2009.\r\n\r\nChildren are initially tested with a capillary, or \u201cfinger prick\u201d blood test. If an elevated level of lead is found, a venous blood test will be administered to confirm the result. For more information on the testing methods, please see the Allegheny County Health Department\u2019s Lead Exposure in Allegheny County report, released in September, 2018. The Allegheny County Health Department currently treats confirmed blood lead level tests with 5 \u00b5g/dL or more of lead as elevated. This measurement is based on the CDC\u2019s reference level for public health action, established in May 2012.\r\n\r\nIf a child under age 6 tests with a confirmed blood lead level of 5 \u00b5g/dl and above, ACHD offers a free home inspection. The goal of this inspection, along with XRF readings, sampling of dust, soil, and water, is to help identify any sources of lead exposure in the home. The inspection includes identifying possible alternative sources of lead exposure from jewelry, toys, cosmetics, parent occupations and/or hobbies. Inspectors also educate the family about how good nutrition can mitigate absorption of lead and immediate steps the family can take to reduce lead exposure in the home. ACHD also offers free lead testing for the uninsured or underinsured at its Immunization clinic, and at WIC offices in McKeesport and Wilkinsburg. \r\n\r\nThe Allegheny Lead Safe Homes Program currently provides free home repairs to keep families safe from lead paint. This program will test for lead-based paint in the home and will aid with repairs and prevention education to Allegheny County homeowners or renters who meet income requirements and whose home is built before 1978. All work is done in a lead-safe manner. Eligible residents must either have a child under 6 years or a pregnant woman in the household.  \r\n\r\nInformation appearing in this description was drawn from the following sources: \r\n\r\nLead Exposure in Allegheny County (September 2018 [pdf report](https://alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Programs/Special_Initiatives/Lead/Lead-paper-9-6-final.pdf))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department\u2019s Lead Exposure Prevention ([Website](https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Lead-Exposure-Prevention.aspx)) \r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department\u2019s Lead Testing ([Website]( https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Testing.aspx))\r\n\r\nData about lead in Allegheny County ([Website](\r\nhttps://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Lead-in-Allegheny-County.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County's Get Ahead of Lead Fact Sheet ([pdf document]( https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Programs/Special_Initiatives/Lead/Get-Ahead-of-Lead_Resources_42-1.pdf))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Health Department\u2019s Approach to Lead ([Website]( https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Approach-to-Lead.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County Lead Safe Homes program information ([Website](\r\nhttps://www.alleghenycounty.us/economic-development/residents/lead-safe-homes-program.aspx))\r\n\r\nAllegheny County\u2019s Article XXIII Blood Lead Testing Regulation ([pdf document]( https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Article-23-Blood-Lead-Level-Testing.pdf))"

The PA UCP is established in accordance with 49 CFR Part 26 and 49 CFR Part 23 (More information can be found at www.ecfr.gov). Allegheny County is a certifying participant in the PA UCP.  Firms wishing to be certified can do so at no cost through the M/W/DBE (Minority, Women, and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise) Department.

      "description": "In Pittsburgh, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people\u2019s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people\u2019s feelings or understanding of this new technology.\r\nWe hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.\r\n\r\nWe conducted our 2017 survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.\r\n\r\nRegarding the 2019 survey: In total, 795 people responded. BikePGH solicited responses from their blog, website, and email list. There were also a few local news articles about the survey. While many questions were kept similar to the 2017 survey, BikePGH wanted to dig a bit deeper into regulations as well as demographics this time around.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 follow up survey also aims to see how the landscape has changed, and how specifically, Pittsburghers on bike and on foot feel about sharing the road with AVs so that we\u2019re all better prepared to deal with this new reality and help make sure that it is introduced as safely as humanly possible."

      "description": "In early 2018, the County Department of Economic Development, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2018 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for Allegheny County.  A similar MVA was completed with the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2016. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality\u2019s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 Allegheny County MVA does not include the City of Pittsburgh, which was characterized at the same time in the fourth update of the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s MVA. All calculations herein therefore do not include the City of Pittsburgh.\r\nWhile the methodology between the City and County MVA's are very similar, the classification of communities will differ, and so the data between the two should not be used interchangeably. \r\n\r\nAllegheny County's MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. Most data used covers the 2013-2016 period, and data used in the analysis includes:\r\n\r\n\u2022Residential Real Estate Sales;\r\n\u2022 Mortgage Foreclosures;\r\n\u2022 Residential Vacancy;\r\n\u2022 Parcel Year Built;\r\n\u2022 Parcel Condition;\r\n\u2022 Owner Occupancy; and\r\n\u2022 Subsidized Housing Units.\r\n\r\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\r\n\r\nDuring the research process, staff from the County and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the report (included here as a pdf) for more information about the data, methodology, and findings."

The question included instructions to \u201cinclude only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.\u201d Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of\r\na person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area.\r\n\r\nSchool enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in \u201cvocational, technical, or business school\u201d such as post secondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and\r\non job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire includes instructions for how to classify home schoolers.\r\n\r\nEnrolled in Public and Private School \u2013 Includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for \u201cpublic school, public college,\u201d or \u201cprivate school, private college, home school.\u201d The instruction guide defines a public school as \u201cany school or college controlled and supported primarily by a local, county, state, or federal government.\u201d Private schools are defined as schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups. Home schools are defined as \u201cparental-guided education outside of public or private school for grades 1-12.\u201d Respondents who marked both the \u201cpublic\u201d and \u201cprivate\u201d\r\nboxes are edited to the first entry, \u201cpublic.\u201d\r\n\r\nGrade in Which Enrolled \u2013 From 1999-2007, in the ACS, people reported to be enrolled in \u201cpublic school, public college\u201d or \u201cprivate school, private college\u201d were classified by grade or level according to responses to Question 10b, \u201cWhat grade or level was this person attending?\u201d Seven levels were identified: \u201cnursery school, preschool;\u201d \u201ckindergarten;\u201d elementary \u201cgrade 1 to grade 4\u201d or \u201cgrade 5 to grade 8;\u201d high school \u201cgrade 9 to grade 12;\u201d \u201ccollege undergraduate years (freshman to senior);\u201d and \u201cgraduate or professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).\u201d\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the school enrollment questions had several changes. \u201cHome school\u201d was explicitly included in the \u201cprivate school, private college\u201d category. For question 10b the categories changed to the following \u201cNursery school, preschool,\u201d \u201cKindergarten,\u201d \u201cGrade 1 through grade 12,\u201d \u201cCollege undergraduate years (freshman to senior),\u201d \u201cGraduate or professional school beyond a bachelor\u2019s degree (for example: MA or PhD program, or medical or law school).\u201d The survey question allowed a write-in for the grades enrolled from 1-12.\r\n\r\nQuestion/Concept History \u2013 Since 1999, the ACS enrollment status question (Question 10a) refers to \u201cregular school or college,\u201d while the 1996-1998 ACS did not restrict reporting to \u201cregular\u201d school, and contained an additional category for the \u201cvocational, technical or business school.\u201d The 1996-1998 ACS used the educational attainment question to estimate level of enrollment for those reported to be enrolled in school, and had a single year write-in for the attainment of\r\ngrades 1 through 11. Grade levels estimated using the attainment question were not consistent with other estimates, so a new question specifically asking grade or level of enrollment was added starting with the 1999 ACS questionnaire.\r\n\r\nLimitation of the Data \u2013 Beginning in 2006, the population universe in the ACS includes people living in group quarters. Data users may see slight differences in levels of school enrollment in any given geographic area due to the inclusion of this population. The extent of this difference, if any, depends on the type of group quarters present and whether the group quarters population makes up a large proportion of the total population. For example, in areas that are home to several colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18 to 24 who were enrolled in college or graduate school would increase, as people living in college dormitories are now included in the universe."

      "title": "Pittsburgh American Community Survey Data 2015 - Household Types",
      "description": "The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to Question 2 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all people in housing units. The question on relationship is essential for classifying the population information on families and other groups. Information about changes in the composition of the American family, from the number of people living alone to the number of children living with only one parent, is essential for planning and carrying out a number of federal programs.\r\n\r\nThe responses to this question were used to determine the relationships of all persons to the householder, as well as household type (married couple family, nonfamily, etc.). From responses to this question, we were able to determine numbers of related children, own children, unmarried partner households, and multi-generational households. We calculated average household and family size. When relationship was not reported, it was imputed using the age difference between the householder and the person, sex, and marital status.\r\n\r\nHousehold \u2013 A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements.\r\n\r\nAverage Household Size \u2013 A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in\r\nhouseholds by the number of households. In cases where people in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, people in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.\r\n\r\nAverage household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.\r\n\r\nComparability \u2013 The relationship categories for the most part can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected in the decennial census, CPS, and SIPP. With the change in 2008 from \u201cIn-law\u201d to the two categories of \u201cParent-in-law\u201d and \u201cSon-in-law or daughter-in-law,\u201d caution should be exercised when comparing data on in-laws from previous years. \u201cIn-law\u201d encompassed any type of in-law such as sister-in-law. Combining \u201cParent-in-law\u201d and \u201cson-in-law or daughter-in-law\u201d does not represent all \u201cin-laws\u201d in 2008. \r\n\r\nThe same can be said of comparing the three categories of \u201cbiological\u201d \u201cstep,\u201d and \u201cadopted\u201d child in 2008 to \u201cChild\u201d in previous years. Before 2008, respondents may have considered anyone under 18 as \u201cchild\u201d and chosen that category. The ACS includes \u201cfoster child\u201d as a category. However, the 2010 Census did not contain this category, and \u201cfoster children\u201d were included in the \u201cOther nonrelative\u201d category. Therefore, comparison of \u201cfoster child\u201d cannot be made to the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2013, the \u201cspouse\u201d category includes same-sex spouses."

      "description": "##Overview\r\n\r\nThis guide to the City of Pittsburgh Smart Streetlight Request for Information (RFI) was created to provide clarity and transparency to the ongoing Smart Streetlight project in the City of Pittsburgh. \r\n\r\nPittsburgh has approximately 40,000 City-owned and operated streetlights, the vast majority of which are traditional high-pressure sodium HID luminaires controlled by simple photocell units. Due to high energy and maintenance costs, the City is developing a plan to replace the bulk of this system with remotely managed LED luminaires, with the goal being a potential energy savings of 60-80%. These savings can finance the conversion program through an Energy Savings Performance Contract. The City has previously piloted this approach in 2012, upgrading 4,500 luminaires through a State-funded energy savings program.  \r\n\r\nThe City recognizes that updated streetlights can offer a ready-made physical and communications platform for the sensors, controls and backhaul that power a Smart City. In the case of a Smart Streetlight deployment however, the problem is not pre-defined, so it is unclear what the City may actually need. This is why the City chose to release an RFI instead of the more common Request for Proposals (RFP), in order to understand the state of the industry, perform a market analysis and provide a learning experience for City personnel.  This RFI was designed to help the City understand the industry's perspective on these emerging technologies while providing a more efficient and equitable lighting system. \r\n\r\nThe City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget released the Smart Streetlights RFI on March 2nd, 2017 and closed it on April 10th, 2017.  The City received twenty-five responses from different businesses who offered a wide variety of services, products and concepts. All of the responses, as well as the RFI itself and the resulting questions and answers, are available to view.\r\n\r\n##\"Smart Cities\"\r\n\r\nThe term \"Smart City\" refers to a range of technologies designed to sense and control various real-world phenomena, and software design and development projects to collect, present and administer those technologies' data and functions. \r\n\r\n##LEDs\r\n\r\nLEDs have a higher efficiency in their conversion of electricity to light. LEDs also last much longer than sodium lamps. They also allow for fine-tuned control to maximize energy savings and performance."

The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality\u2019s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies. \r\n\r\nPittsburgh\u2019s 2016 MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market between July, 2013 and June, 2016:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tMedian Sales Price\r\n\r\n\u2022\tVariance of Sales Price\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPercent Households Owner Occupied\r\n\r\n\u2022\tDensity of Residential Housing Units\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPercent Rental with Subsidy\r\n\r\n\u2022\tForeclosures as a Percent of Sales\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPermits as a Percent of Housing Units\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPercent of Housing Units Built Before 1940\r\n\r\n\u2022\tPercent of Properties with Assessed Condition \u201cPoor\u201d or worse\r\n\r\n\u2022\tVacant Housing Units as a Percentage of Habitable Units\r\n\r\nThe MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.\r\n\r\nDuring the research process, staff from the URA and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market."
