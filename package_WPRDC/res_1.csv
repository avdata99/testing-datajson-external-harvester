Police Incident Blotter (30 Day),"The 30 Day Police Blotter contains the most recent initial crime incident data, updated on a nightly basis. All data is reported at the block/intersection level, with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. The information is ""semi-refined"" meaning a police report was taken, but it has not made its way through the court system. This data is subject to change once it is processed and republished using Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) standards. The UCR coding process creates a necessary delay before processed data is available for publication. Therefore, the 30 Day blotter will provide information for users seeking the most current information available.   

This dataset will be continually overwritten and any records older than thirty days will be removed. Validated incidents will be moved to the Police Blotter Archive Dataset. Data in the archived file is of a higher quality and is the file most appropriate for reporting crime statistics.

Allegheny County Hydrology Lines,"<p>The Hydrology Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled water
drainage features and structures including rivers, streams, drainage canals,
locks, dams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and mooring cells. Rivers, Lakes, Ponds,
Reservoirs, Hidden Lakes, Reservoirs or Ponds: If greater than 25 feet and less
than 30 feet wide, is captured as a double line stream. If greater than 30 feet
wide it is captured as a river. Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater
than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream
edges and River Edges.  The Ohio River,
Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major Rivers. All other
River and Stream polygons are coded as River. If a stream is less than 25 feet
wide it is placed as a single line and coded as a Stream.  Both sides of the stream are digitized and
coded as a Stream for Streams whose width is greater than 25 feet.  River edges are digitized and coded as River.
A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic feature.  Drainage Canals are differentiated from
streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or bottom stabilized to
prevent erosion for the predominant length of the feature.  Streams may have had some stabilization done,
but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than five acres in size.  Ponds are
large standing bodies of water greater than one acre in size and less than five
acres in size.  Reservoirs are manmade
embankments of water.  Included in this
definition are both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are
greater than one acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and
Hidden Drainage Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water
flows through a manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not
being updated but will be preserved.  If
a drainage feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the
associated drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a
structure to which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage.  They are normally constructed of concrete and
steel and are anchored to the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling.
Mooring Cells do not currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will
be added. Locks are devices that are used to control flow or access to a
hydrologic feature.  The edges of the
Lock are captured.  Dams are devices that
are used to hold or delay the natural flow of water.  The edges of the Dam are shown.</p>

<p>Development Notes:  This data set is a digital soil survey and
generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the
National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing,
or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This
data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute
data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a
detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that
normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be
cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer
(point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of
features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough
and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil
map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System
relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component
soils and their properties.  The soil map
and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of
the National Cooperative Soil Survey</p>

Allegheny County Hydrology Areas,"<p>The Hydrology Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled water
drainage features and structures including rivers, streams, drainage canals,
locks, dams, lakes, ponds, reservoirs and mooring cells.  Lakes are large standing bodies of water
greater than 5 acres in size. Ponds are large standing bodies of water greater
than 1 acre and less than 5 acres in size. Polygons are created from Stream
edges and River Edges.  The Ohio River,
Monongahela River and Allegheny River are coded as Major River polygons.  All other River and Stream polygons are coded
as River. A Drainage Canal is a manmade or channelized hydrographic
feature.  Drainage Canals are
differentiated from streams in that drainage canals have had the sides and/or
bottom stabilized to prevent erosion for the predominant length of the
feature.  Streams may have had some
stabilization done, but are primarily in a natural state. Lakes are large
standing bodies of water greater than five acres in size.  Ponds are large standing bodies of water
greater than one acre in size and less than five acres in size.  Reservoirs are manmade embankments of
water.  Included in this definition are
both covered and uncovered water tanks. Reservoirs that are greater than one
acre in size are digitized. Hidden Streams, Hidden Rivers and Hidden Drainage
Canal or Culverts are those areas of drainage where the water flows through a
manmade facility such as a culvert. Hydrology Annotation is not being updated
but will be preserved.  If a drainage
feature has been removed, as apparent on the aerial photography, the associated
drainage name annotation will be removed. A Mooring Cell is a structure to
which tows can tie off while awaiting lockage. 
They are normally constructed of concrete and steel and are anchored to
the river bottom by means of gravity or sheet piling. Mooring Cells do not
currently exist in the Allegheny County dataset but will be added. Locks are
devices that are used to control flow or access to a hydrologic feature.  The edges of the Lock are captured.  Dams are devices that are used to hold or
delay the natural flow of water.  The
edges of the Dam are shown.</p>

Allegheny County Land Use Areas,"<p>Allegheny County land use as ascribed to areas of land. The Land Use
Feature Dataset contains photogrammetrically compiled information concerning
vegetation and limited open areas of ground. The Land Use Feature Dataset
contains Woodlands, Nurseries and Orchards, Cultivated Fields and Athletic
Fields. Woodlands are groups of trees, whether coniferous or deciduous.
Woodland areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the
aerial photography. Nurseries and Orchards are areas that indicate cultivated
trees. These areas are usually identified because the trees are found in evenly
spaced rows. Nursery and Orchard areas that are one (1) acre or greater in size
are digitized from the aerial photography. Cultivated Fields are those areas
that are used for crops. Pasture land and land that, according to the aerial
photographs and aerial interpretation, has been permitted to lie fallow for an
extended period is not considered cultivated areas. Cultivated Field areas that
are one (1) acre or greater in size are digitized from the aerial photography.
Athletic Fields are sport fields that have a natural surface. The apparent
outline of the land area used for athletic purposes is digitized from the
aerial photography and not just the actual athletic field.</p>

Special consideration is given to garages that are less than 400 square
feet and will be digitized when greater than 200 square feet.  Interim rooflines, such as dormers and party
walls, as well as minor structures, such as carports, decks, patios, stairs,
etc., and impermanent structures, such as sheds, are not shown. Large buildings
which appear to house activities that are commercial or industrial in nature
are shown as commercial/industrial. Structures that appear to be primarily
residential in nature, including hotels and apartment buildings are shown as
residential buildings. Structures which appear to be used or owned primarily by
governmental, nonprofit, religious, or charitable organizations, or which serve
a public function are shown as public buildings. Structures which are closely
associated with a larger building, such as a garage, are shown as an out
building. Structures which cannot be clearly defined as Industrial/Commercial;
Residential; Public; or Out Buildings are flagged as such for later
categorization. The classification of buildings is subject to the
interpretation from the aerial photography and may not reflect the building’s
actual use.  Buildings that have an area
less than the minimum required size for data capture will occasionally be
present in the Geodatabase.  Buildings
are not removed after they have been digitized and determined to be less than
the minimum required size.<br /><br />

Allegheny County Mortgage Foreclosure Records,"This data includes filings related to mortgage foreclosure in Allegheny County. The foreclosure process enables a lender to take possession of a property due to an owner's failure to make mortgage payments.  Mortgage foreclosure differs from tax foreclosure, which is a process enabling local governments to take possession of a property if the owner fails to pay property taxes.

As Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state, a lender files for foreclosure through the court system.  Foreclosure data in the court system is maintained by the Allegheny County Department of Court Records. Data included here is from the general docket, and a  mortgage foreclosure docket created to help homeowners maintain ownership of their property following an initial filing. Several different types of legal filings may occur on a property involved in the foreclosure process. At this time, only the most recent filing in a case is included in the data found here, but we hope to add all filings for a case in the coming months.

After a property enters the foreclosure process, several potential outcomes are possible. Some of the more common outcomes include:  borrowers may come to an agreement with the lender for unpaid debt; borrowers may sell the property to satisfy part or all of the debt; borrowers may voluntarily relinquish ownership to the lender; lenders may decide not to pursue the foreclosure any further; and the property may proceed all the way through a sheriff sale, where it is sold to a new owner.

The data presented here is in beta form because only the most recent filing type is included as of September 2017.  Monthly updates are forthcoming.  It is also our intent to include a record for each filing type for each docket if the data becomes available.",f2141a79-c0b9-4cf9-b4d2-d591b4aaa8e6,

Allegheny County Property Sale Transactions,"This dataset contains data on all Real Property parcels that have sold since 2013 in Allegheny County, PA.

Before doing any market analysis on property sales, check the sales validation codes. Many property ""sales"" are not considered a valid representation of the true market value of the property. For example, when multiple lots are together on one deed with one price they are generally coded as invalid (""H"") because the sale price for each parcel ID number indicates the total price paid for a group of parcels, not just for one parcel. See the Sales Validation Codes Dictionary for a complete explanation of valid and invalid sale codes.

Sales Transactions Disclaimer: Sales information is provided from the Allegheny County Department of Administrative Services, Real Estate Division. Content and validation codes are subject to change. Please review the Data Dictionary for details on included fields before each use. Property owners are not required by law to record a deed at the time of sale.

Pittsburgh Police Firearm Seizures,"This data includes counts of  firearms by type seized by the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Each row describes a seizure incident involving one or more firearms.
 
Firearm seizures can occur for several reasons. One of the Bureau of Police justifications for seizing a firearm involves a suspicion that a firearm was used in a criminal offense. Seizures may also occur to protect officer or public safety. For example, a weapon held by someone involved in a serious medical emergency, or an unattended  weapon found in a public space may be seized and held for safekeeping.
 
The Bureau’s firearms tracking unit conducts investigations to determine the rightful owner of firearms that have been seized. Where possible, the Bureau makes every effort to return firearms that have been seized to their rightful owners.
 
Firearms seized by non-City of Pittsburgh law enforcement agencies within the City of Pittsburgh may not be included in this data. Federal, State, County, and other special law enforcement agencies (e.g. campus, transit, hospital, etc.) operate within the City limits.
 
Data collected through supplemental reports filled out by Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers upon taking possession of a firearm.
 
Locations where the seizure occurred  are anonymized to the address block or nearest intersection. It's not always possible to geocode these anonymized addresses.  In cases where geocoding fails, the latitude and longitude fields are left empty.  These will display as ""None"" in table views on the WPRDC site.

Allegheny County 911 Dispatches - EMS and Fire,"The Allegheny County 911 center answers and dispatches 911 calls for 111 out of 130 municipalities in Allegheny County. Agencies are dispatched via a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system. This dataset contains dispatched EMS and Fire events from the CAD and includes details about the nature of the emergency.

To protect the privacy of callers and prevent sensitive health or other identifying information being revealed, the following steps were taken:
  
* Aggregated event location to census block groups.  
* Aggregated call date/time to quarter and year. 
* Shortened call types to remove potentially identifying information. 
* Flagged certain call types as containing sensitive health information, such as mental health issues, overdose, etc.  
* Checked frequency of calls w/ sensitive health information: 
    * If the number of calls for a certain month/year and census block group was greater than 5, the call description was included.  
    * If less than 5, the call description was redacted. 

Events requiring EMS and Fire services will appear in both datasets with a different Call ID. Events requiring two agencies of the same service (e.g. two or more different fire companies responded to a major fire) will only list the primary responder.

The call descriptions are based on information provided by the caller. The calls are not later updated with a disposition or correction if the original description was inaccurate. For example, if EMS is dispatched to the scene of a stroke, but the person actually had a heart attack, that record would not be updated later with the correct description. 

A small subset of the CAD data had no call type recorded. These records are preserved with a ""null"" in the Description_Short field. Redacted call types are listed as ""Removed"".

Allegheny County Elevated Blood Lead Level Rates,"Lead is a neurotoxin commonly found in our daily lives. While lead has been eliminated from gasoline, household paint, and solder, you can still be exposed to lead from many different sources including dust containing lead from pre-1978 lead paint, paint chips, contaminated soils, water, ceramic plates, bowls, and glasses, and imported candy, toys, cosmetics, and jewelry

Lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, academic achievement, and other behavioral issues.

As of January 1, 2018, Allegheny County requires every child under age six to be tested for lead exposure. The first of two tests will be conducted when a child is approximately 9-12 months old, and the second test will take place around the child’s second birthday. According to the Allegheny County Health Department, 53% of County children born in 2016 were tested for lead between the ages of nine to 12 months. This share has risen from 30% of County children born in 2009.

Children are initially tested with a capillary, or “finger prick” blood test. If an elevated level of lead is found, a venous blood test will be administered to confirm the result. For more information on the testing methods, please see the Allegheny County Health Department’s Lead Exposure in Allegheny County report, released in September, 2018. The Allegheny County Health Department currently treats confirmed blood lead level tests with 5 µg/dL or more of lead as elevated. This measurement is based on the CDC’s reference level for public health action, established in May 2012.

If a child under age 6 tests with a confirmed blood lead level of 5 µg/dl and above, ACHD offers a free home inspection. The goal of this inspection, along with XRF readings, sampling of dust, soil, and water, is to help identify any sources of lead exposure in the home. The inspection includes identifying possible alternative sources of lead exposure from jewelry, toys, cosmetics, parent occupations and/or hobbies. Inspectors also educate the family about how good nutrition can mitigate absorption of lead and immediate steps the family can take to reduce lead exposure in the home. ACHD also offers free lead testing for the uninsured or underinsured at its Immunization clinic, and at WIC offices in McKeesport and Wilkinsburg. 

The Allegheny Lead Safe Homes Program currently provides free home repairs to keep families safe from lead paint. This program will test for lead-based paint in the home and will aid with repairs and prevention education to Allegheny County homeowners or renters who meet income requirements and whose home is built before 1978. All work is done in a lead-safe manner. Eligible residents must either have a child under 6 years or a pregnant woman in the household.

Autonomous Vehicle Survey of Bicyclists and Pedestrians in Pittsburgh,"In Pittsburgh, Autonomous Vehicle (AV) companies have been testing autonomous vehicles since September 2016. However, the tech is new, and there have been some high-profile behavior that we believe warrants a larger conversation. So in early 2017, we set out to design a survey to see both how BikePGH donor-members, and Pittsburgh residents at large, feel about about sharing the road with AVs as a bicyclist and/or as a pedestrian. Our survey asked participants how they feel about being a fellow road user with AVs, either walking or biking. We also wanted to collect stories about people’s experiences interacting with this nascent technology. We are unaware of any public surveys about people’s feelings or understanding of this new technology.
We hope that our results will help add to the body of data and help the public and politicians understand the complexity of possible futures that different economic models AV technology can bring to our cities and towncenters.

We conducted our 2017 survey in two parts. First, we launched the survey exclusively to donor-members, yielding 321 responses (out of 2,900) via email. Once we closed the survey, we launched it again, but allowed the general public to take it. Through promoting it on our website, social media channels, and a few news articles, we yielded 798 responses (mostly from people in the Pittsburgh region), for a combined total of 1,119 responses.

Regarding the 2019 survey: In total, 795 people responded. BikePGH solicited responses from their blog, website, and email list. There were also a few local news articles about the survey. While many questions were kept similar to the 2017 survey, BikePGH wanted to dig a bit deeper into regulations as well as demographics this time around.

The 2019 follow up survey also aims to see how the landscape has changed, and how specifically, Pittsburghers on bike and on foot feel about sharing the road with AVs so that we’re all better prepared to deal with this new reality and help make sure that it is introduced as safely as humanly possible.",0b584c84-7e35-4f4d-a5a2-b01697470c0f,

Market Value Analysis - Allegheny County Economic Development,"In early 2018, the County Department of Economic Development, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2018 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for Allegheny County.  A similar MVA was completed with the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2016. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional community boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies.

The 2016 Allegheny County MVA does not include the City of Pittsburgh, which was characterized at the same time in the fourth update of the City of Pittsburgh’s MVA. All calculations herein therefore do not include the City of Pittsburgh.
While the methodology between the City and County MVA's are very similar, the classification of communities will differ, and so the data between the two should not be used interchangeably. 

Allegheny County's MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market. Most data used covers the 2013-2016 period, and data used in the analysis includes:

•Residential Real Estate Sales;
• Mortgage Foreclosures;
• Residential Vacancy;
• Parcel Year Built;
• Parcel Condition;
• Owner Occupancy; and
• Subsidized Housing Units.

The MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

During the research process, staff from the County and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.

"Pittsburgh American Community Survey 2015, School Enrollment","School enrollment data are used to assess the socioeconomic condition of school-age children. Government agencies also require these data for funding allocations and program planning and implementation.

Data on school enrollment and grade or level attending were derived from answers to Question 10 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). People were classified as enrolled in school if they were attending a public or private school or college at any time during the 3 months prior to the time of interview. The question included instructions to “include only nursery or preschool, kindergarten, elementary school, home school, and schooling which leads to a high school diploma, or a college degree.” Respondents who did not answer the enrollment question were assigned the enrollment status and type of school of
a person with the same age, sex, race, and Hispanic or Latino origin whose residence was in the same or nearby area.

School enrollment is only recorded if the schooling advances a person toward an elementary school certificate, a high school diploma, or a college, university, or professional school (such as law or medicine) degree. Tutoring or correspondence schools are included if credit can be obtained from a public or private school or college. People enrolled in “vocational, technical, or business school” such as post secondary vocational, trade, hospital school, and
on job training were not reported as enrolled in school. Field interviewers were instructed to classify individuals who were home schooled as enrolled in private school. The guide sent out with the mail questionnaire includes instructions for how to classify home schoolers.

Enrolled in Public and Private School – Includes people who attended school in the reference period and indicated they were enrolled by marking one of the questionnaire categories for “public school, public college,” or “private school, private college, home school.” The instruction guide defines a public school as “any school or college controlled and supported primarily by a local, county, state, or federal government.” Private schools are defined as schools supported and controlled primarily by religious organizations or other private groups. Home schools are defined as “parental-guided education outside of public or private school for grades 1-12.” Respondents who marked both the “public” and “private”
boxes are edited to the first entry, “public.”

Grade in Which Enrolled – From 1999-2007, in the ACS, people reported to be enrolled in “public school, public college” or “private school, private college” were classified by grade or level according to responses to Question 10b, “What grade or level was this person attending?” Seven levels were identified: “nursery school, preschool;” “kindergarten;” elementary “grade 1 to grade 4” or “grade 5 to grade 8;” high school “grade 9 to grade 12;” “college undergraduate years (freshman to senior);” and “graduate or professional school (for example: medical, dental, or law school).”

In 2008, the school enrollment questions had several changes. “Home school” was explicitly included in the “private school, private college” category. For question 10b the categories changed to the following “Nursery school, preschool,” “Kindergarten,” “Grade 1 through grade 12,” “College undergraduate years (freshman to senior),” “Graduate or professional school beyond a bachelor’s degree (for example: MA or PhD program, or medical or law school).” The survey question allowed a write-in for the grades enrolled from 1-12.

Question/Concept History – Since 1999, the ACS enrollment status question (Question 10a) refers to “regular school or college,” while the 1996-1998 ACS did not restrict reporting to “regular” school, and contained an additional category for the “vocational, technical or business school.” The 1996-1998 ACS used the educational attainment question to estimate level of enrollment for those reported to be enrolled in school, and had a single year write-in for the attainment of
grades 1 through 11. Grade levels estimated using the attainment question were not consistent with other estimates, so a new question specifically asking grade or level of enrollment was added starting with the 1999 ACS questionnaire.

Limitation of the Data – Beginning in 2006, the population universe in the ACS includes people living in group quarters. Data users may see slight differences in levels of school enrollment in any given geographic area due to the inclusion of this population. The extent of this difference, if any, depends on the type of group quarters present and whether the group quarters population makes up a large proportion of the total population. For example, in areas that are home to several colleges and universities, the percent of individuals 18 to 24 who were enrolled in college or graduate school would increase, as people living in college dormitories are now included in the universe.",3cb2b9c2-66e2-4ffa-b0a1-35fb2c6f7230,

Pittsburgh American Community Survey Census Data 2014 - Sex by Occupation,"Occupation describes the kind of work a person does on the job. Occupation data were derived from answers to questions 45 and 46 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS). Question 45 asks: “What kind of work was this person doing?” Question 46 asks: “What were this person’s most important activities or duties?”

These questions were asked of all people 15 years old and over who had worked in the past 5 years. For employed people, the data refer to the person’s job during the previous week. For those who worked two or more jobs, the data refer to the job where the person worked the greatest number of hours. For unemployed people and people who are not currently employed but report having a job within the last five years, the data refer to their last job.

These questions describe the work activity and occupational experience of the American labor force. Data are used to formulate policy and programs for employment, career development, and training; to provide information on the occupational skills of the labor force in a given area to analyze career trends; and to measure compliance with antidiscrimination policies. Companies use these data to decide where to locate new plants, stores, or offices.",378e4a6c-550c-4e9c-bfb5-ca73c1c29cc7,
Pittsburgh American Community Survey Data 2015 - Household Types,"The data on relationship to householder were derived from answers to Question 2 in the 2015 American Community Survey (ACS), which was asked of all people in housing units. The question on relationship is essential for classifying the population information on families and other groups. Information about changes in the composition of the American family, from the number of people living alone to the number of children living with only one parent, is essential for planning and carrying out a number of federal programs.

The responses to this question were used to determine the relationships of all persons to the householder, as well as household type (married couple family, nonfamily, etc.). From responses to this question, we were able to determine numbers of related children, own children, unmarried partner households, and multi-generational households. We calculated average household and family size. When relationship was not reported, it was imputed using the age difference between the householder and the person, sex, and marital status.

Household – A household includes all the people who occupy a housing unit. (People not living in households are classified as living in group quarters.) A housing unit is a house, an apartment, a mobile home, a group of rooms, or a single room that is occupied (or if vacant, is intended for occupancy) as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants live separately from any other people in the building and which have direct access from the outside of the building or through a common hall. The occupants may be a single family, one person living alone, two or more families living together, or any other group of related or unrelated people who share living arrangements.

Average Household Size – A measure obtained by dividing the number of people in
households by the number of households. In cases where people in households are cross-classified by race or Hispanic origin, people in the household are classified by the race or Hispanic origin of the householder rather than the race or Hispanic origin of each individual.

Average household size is rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Comparability – The relationship categories for the most part can be compared to previous ACS years and to similar data collected in the decennial census, CPS, and SIPP. With the change in 2008 from “In-law” to the two categories of “Parent-in-law” and “Son-in-law or daughter-in-law,” caution should be exercised when comparing data on in-laws from previous years. “In-law” encompassed any type of in-law such as sister-in-law. Combining “Parent-in-law” and “son-in-law or daughter-in-law” does not represent all “in-laws” in 2008. 

The same can be said of comparing the three categories of “biological” “step,” and “adopted” child in 2008 to “Child” in previous years. Before 2008, respondents may have considered anyone under 18 as “child” and chosen that category. The ACS includes “foster child” as a category. However, the 2010 Census did not contain this category, and “foster children” were included in the “Other nonrelative” category. Therefore, comparison of “foster child” cannot be made to the 2010 Census. Beginning in 2013, the “spouse” category includes same-sex spouses.",307d923c-418e-4838-b2b9-d0896d483f33,

Smart Streetlight RFI Responses,"##Overview

This guide to the City of Pittsburgh Smart Streetlight Request for Information (RFI) was created to provide clarity and transparency to the ongoing Smart Streetlight project in the City of Pittsburgh. 

Pittsburgh has approximately 40,000 City-owned and operated streetlights, the vast majority of which are traditional high-pressure sodium HID luminaires controlled by simple photocell units. Due to high energy and maintenance costs, the City is developing a plan to replace the bulk of this system with remotely managed LED luminaires, with the goal being a potential energy savings of 60-80%. These savings can finance the conversion program through an Energy Savings Performance Contract. The City has previously piloted this approach in 2012, upgrading 4,500 luminaires through a State-funded energy savings program.  

The City recognizes that updated streetlights can offer a ready-made physical and communications platform for the sensors, controls and backhaul that power a Smart City. In the case of a Smart Streetlight deployment however, the problem is not pre-defined, so it is unclear what the City may actually need. This is why the City chose to release an RFI instead of the more common Request for Proposals (RFP), in order to understand the state of the industry, perform a market analysis and provide a learning experience for City personnel.  This RFI was designed to help the City understand the industry's perspective on these emerging technologies while providing a more efficient and equitable lighting system. 

The City of Pittsburgh Office of Management and Budget released the Smart Streetlights RFI on March 2nd, 2017 and closed it on April 10th, 2017.  The City received twenty-five responses from different businesses who offered a wide variety of services, products and concepts. All of the responses, as well as the RFI itself and the resulting questions and answers, are available to view.

Market Value Analysis - Urban Redevelopment Authority,"In late 2016, the URA, in conjunction with Reinvestment Fund, completed the 2016 Market Value Analysis (MVA) for the City of Pittsburgh. The Market Value Analysis (MVA) offers an approach for community revitalization; it recommends applying interventions not only to where there is a need for development but also in places where public investment can stimulate private market activity and capitalize on larger public investment activities. The MVA is a unique tool for characterizing markets because it creates an internally referenced index of a municipality’s residential real estate market. It identifies areas that are the highest demand markets as well as areas of greatest distress, and the various markets types between. The MVA offers insight into the variation in market strength and weakness within and between traditional neighborhood boundaries because it uses Census block groups as the unit of analysis. Where market types abut each other on the map becomes instructive about the potential direction of market change, and ultimately, the appropriateness of types of investment or intervention strategies. 

Pittsburgh’s 2016 MVA utilized data that helps to define the local real estate market between July, 2013 and June, 2016:

•	Median Sales Price

•	Variance of Sales Price

•	Percent Households Owner Occupied

•	Density of Residential Housing Units

•	Percent Rental with Subsidy

•	Foreclosures as a Percent of Sales

•	Permits as a Percent of Housing Units

•	Percent of Housing Units Built Before 1940

•	Percent of Properties with Assessed Condition “Poor” or worse

•	Vacant Housing Units as a Percentage of Habitable Units

The MVA uses a statistical technique known as cluster analysis, forming groups of areas (i.e., block groups) that are similar along the MVA descriptors, noted above. The goal is to form groups within which there is a similarity of characteristics within each group, but each group itself different from the others. Using this technique, the MVA condenses vast amounts of data for the universe of all properties to a manageable, meaningful typology of market types that can inform area-appropriate programs and decisions regarding the allocation of resources.

During the research process, staff from the URA and Reinvestment Fund spent an extensive amount of effort ensuring the data and analysis was accurate. In addition to testing the data, staff physically examined different areas to verify the data sets being used were appropriate indicators and the resulting MVA categories accurately reflect the market.",cde6ac1b-d503-4dd8-8d4c-b4f106dd1950,
